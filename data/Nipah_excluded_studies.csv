Animal models for some important RNA viruses of public health concern in SEARO countries: viral hemorrhagic fever.,Badole SL.; Yadav PD.; Patil DR.; Mourya DT.,"Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are major public health problems in the South-East Asia Regional (SEAR) countries. VHFs are a group of illnesses; that are caused by four families of viruses, viz. Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae and Flaviviridae. All VHFs have common features: they affect several organs and damage the blood vessels. These symptoms are often accompanied by hemorrhage. To understand pathogenesis, genetic and environmental influence that increase the risk of VHFs, efficacy and safety studies on candidate vaccines and testing of various therapeutic agents, appropriate animal models are essential tools in public and animals health. In the current review, the suitable animal models for Flavivirus [Dengue hemorhagic fever (DHF), Kyasanur forest disease (KFD)]; Bunyavirus [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Hantavirus fever (HF)]; and Paramyxovirus [Nipah virus fever (NiV)] have been reviewed with specific emphasis on emerging and reemerging viruses in SEAR countries.",2015,Mar,Journal of vector borne diseases,52,1,1-10,,,25815861,#467,Badole 2015,Exclusion reason: No report of parameters (including seroprevalance and other measures of interest) or transmission or historical outbreaks; ,""
[Emerging viral infections in South East Asia and the Pacific region].,Barboza P.; Tarantola A.; Lassel L.; Mollet T.; Quatresous I.; Paquet C.,"The epidemiology of several viral diseases underwent profound changes in South-East Asia and Oceania over the past decades. This was due to several factors, including the geographical distribution of vectors and the viruses they transmit; increasing traveling and trade; increasing ecological and demographic pressure. We reviewed the current state of knowledge based on published sources and available epidemiological data. The review was limited to potentially emerging viruses in Southeast Asia and the Pacific reported in human cases. Dengue, Chikungunya, and Japanese Encephalitis viruses have recurred on a yearly basis with a steady increase in these regions. Ross River and Barmah viruses now appear regularly in Australia, in an increasing number of cases. Nipah virus strikes regularly with limited but deadly epidemics in Southeast Asia. Finally, infections by lyssaviruses, Kunjin, Murray Valley, or Zika viruses were also reviewed.",2008,Oct,Medecine et maladies infectieuses,38,10,513-23,,10.1016/j.medmal.2008.06.011,18771865,#490,Barboza 2008,Exclusion reason: Not in English; ,""
A Review of the Current Status of Relevant Zoonotic Pathogens in Wild Swine (Sus scrofa) Populations: Changes Modulating the Risk of Transmission to Humans.,Ruiz-Fons F.,"Many wild swine populations in different parts of the World have experienced an unprecedented demographic explosion that may result in increased exposure of humans to wild swine zoonotic pathogens. Interactions between humans and wild swine leading to pathogen transmission could come from different ways, being hunters and game professionals the most exposed to acquiring infections from wild swine. However, increasing human settlements in semi-natural areas, outdoor activities, socio-economic changes and food habits may increase the rate of exposure to wild swine zoonotic pathogens and to potentially emerging pathogens from wild swine. Frequent and increasing contact rate between humans and wild swine points to an increasing chance of zoonotic pathogens arising from wild swine to be transmitted to humans. Whether this frequent contact could lead to new zoonotic pathogens emerging from wild swine to cause human epidemics or emerging disease outbreaks is difficult to predict, and assessment should be based on thorough epidemiologic surveillance. Additionally, several gaps in knowledge on wild swine global population dynamics trends and wild swine-zoonotic pathogen interactions should be addressed to correctly assess the potential role of wild swine in the emergence of diseases in humans. In this work, viruses such as hepatitis E virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Influenza virus and Nipah virus, and bacteria such as Salmonella spp., Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp. and Leptospira spp. have been identified as the most prone to be transmitted from wild swine to humans on the basis of geographic spread in wild swine populations worldwide, pathogen circulation rates in wild swine populations, wild swine population trends in endemic areas, susceptibility of humans to infection, transmissibility from wild swine to humans and existing evidence of wild swine-human transmission events.",2017,Feb,Transboundary and emerging diseases,64,1,68-88,,10.1111/tbed.12369,25953392,#499,Ruiz-Fons 2017,Exclusion reason: No report of parameters (including seroprevalance and other measures of interest) or transmission or historical outbreaks; ,Review paper
Using network theory to identify the causes of disease outbreaks of unknown origin.,Bogich TL.; Funk S.; Malcolm TR.; Chhun N.; Epstein JH.; Chmura AA.; Kilpatrick AM.; Brownstein JS.; Hutchison OC.; Doyle-Capitman C.; Deaville R.; Morse SS.; Cunningham AA.; Daszak P.,"The identification of undiagnosed disease outbreaks is critical for mobilizing efforts to prevent widespread transmission of novel virulent pathogens. Recent developments in online surveillance systems allow for the rapid communication of the earliest reports of emerging infectious diseases and tracking of their spread. The efficacy of these programs, however, is inhibited by the anecdotal nature of informal reporting and uncertainty of pathogen identity in the early stages of emergence. We developed theory to connect disease outbreaks of known aetiology in a network using an array of properties including symptoms, seasonality and case-fatality ratio. We tested the method with 125 reports of outbreaks of 10 known infectious diseases causing encephalitis in South Asia, and showed that different diseases frequently form distinct clusters within the networks. The approach correctly identified unknown disease outbreaks with an average sensitivity of 76 per cent and specificity of 88 per cent. Outbreaks of some diseases, such as Nipah virus encephalitis, were well identified (sensitivity = 100%, positive predictive values = 80%), whereas others (e.g. Chandipura encephalitis) were more difficult to distinguish.

Nipah virus encephalitis.,Tan CT.; Chua KB.,"Nipah virus was first discovered in 1999, after a severe outbreak of viral encephalitis among pig farm workers in Malaysia. The disease is thought to spread from Pteropus bats to pigs and then to humans following close contact. The reported mortality rate in this outbreak was 40%. The main necropsy finding in patients with Nipah virus encephalitis was disseminated microinfarction associated with vasculitis and direct neuronal involvement. Relapse of encephalitis was seen in 10% of those who survived the initial illness. Since that initial report, recurrent outbreaks of Nipah virus encephalitis have been seen in Bangladesh and West Bengal, India. These outbreaks occurred between January and May, with Pteropus giganteus as a reservoir of the virus. In Bangladesh, the virus probably spread directly from bats to humans-with human to human spread as another important mode of infection-and the mortality rate was 70%.",2008,Jul,Current infectious disease reports,10,4,315-20,,,18765105,#658,Tan 2008,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper
A longitudinal study of the prevalence of Nipah virus in Pteropus lylei bats in Thailand: evidence for seasonal preference in disease transmission.,Wacharapluesadee S.; Boongird K.; Wanghongsa S.; Ratanasetyuth N.; Supavonwong P.; Saengsen D.; Gongal GN.; Hemachudha T.,"After 12 serial Nipah virus outbreaks in humans since 1998, it has been noted that all except the initial event in Malaysia occurred during the first 5 months of the year. Increasingly higher morbidity and mortality have been observed in subsequent outbreaks in India and Bangladesh. This may have been related to different virus strains and transmission capability from bat to human without the need for an amplifying host and direct human-to-human transmission. A survey of virus strains in Pteropus lylei and seasonal preference for spillover of these viruses was completed in seven provinces of Central Thailand between May 2005 and June 2007. Nipah virus RNA sequences, which belonged to those of the Malaysian and Bangladesh strains, were detected in the urine of these bats, with the Bangladesh strain being dominant. Highest recovery of Nipah virus RNA was observed in May. Of two provincial sites where monthly surveys were done, the Bangladesh strain was almost exclusively detected during April to June. The Malaysian strain was found dispersed during December to June. Although direct contact during breeding (in December to April) was believed to be an important transmission factor, our results may not entirely support the role of breeding activities in spillage of virus. Greater virus shedding over extended periods in the case of the Malaysian strain and the highest peak of virus detection in May in the case of the Bangladesh strain when offspring started to separate may suggest that there may be responsible mechanisms other than direct contact during breeding in the same roost. Knowledge of seasonal preferences of Nipah virus shedding in P. lylei will help us to better understand the dynamics of Nipah virus transmission and have implications for disease management.",2010,Mar,"Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)",10,2,183-90,,10.1089/vbz.2008.0105,19402762,#746,Wacharapluesadee 2010,"Exclusion reason: No report of parameters (including seroprevalance and other measures of interest) or transmission or historical outbreaks; Thomas Rawson (2025-02-13 23:27:31)(Included): Good paper but nothing to extract.

Domesticated animals as hosts of henipaviruses and filoviruses: A systematic review.,Glennon EE.; Restif O.; Sbarbaro SR.; Garnier R.; Cunningham AA.; Suu-Ire RD.; Osei-Amponsah R.; Wood JLN.; Peel AJ.,"Bat-borne viruses carry undeniable risks to the health of human beings and animals, and there is growing recognition of the need for a 'One Health' approach to understand their frequently complex spill-over routes. While domesticated animals can play central roles in major spill-over events of zoonotic bat-borne viruses, for example during the pig-amplified Malaysian Nipah virus outbreak of 1998-1999, the extent of their potential to act as bridging or amplifying species for these viruses has not been characterised systematically. This review aims to compile current knowledge on the role of domesticated animals as hosts of two types of bat-borne viruses, henipaviruses and filoviruses. A systematic literature search of these virus-host interactions in domesticated animals identified 72 relevant studies, which were categorised by year, location, design and type of evidence generated. The review then focusses on Africa as a case study, comparing research efforts in domesticated animals and bats with the distributions of documented human cases.

Henipaviruses: a new family of emerging Paramyxoviruses.,Wild TF.,"Paramyxoviruses have been implicated in both animal and human infections. Some viruses, such as Morbilliviruses are responsible for large-scale epidemics. However, there are limited observations of these viruses crossing the host species barrier in nature. In 1994, in Australia a fatal infection in horses and humans was identified to be caused by a new Paramyxovirus, Hendra virus (HeV), and in 1998 in Malaysia, a closely related virus, Nipah virus (NiV) was responsible for fatal infections in pigs and humans. These two viruses were sufficiently different from previously described Paramyxoviruses to create a new genus, Henipaviruses. The natural reservoir of these viruses was the fruit bat (Pteropus), which is found in regions extending from the western Pacific to the eastern coast of Africa. Serological studies have established that as many as half the fruit bats in colonies throughout these regions may have antibodies against this family of viruses. The availability of diagnostic reagents for Nipah virus in humans have identified infections in several countries including, Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. In some of these epidemics, mortality in humans exceeds 75%. Deforestation is probably responsible for fruit bats leaving their ecological niches and approaching farms and villages. The infection of humans and animals may occur via contaminated foods or in certain cases by animals to man. At present, only within close families has human-to-human transmission been proposed. Henipavirus infections are probably more widespread than it is at presently known and so it is important to have an intense monitoring for these diseases, especially in countries where large-scale deforestation is happening.",2009,Mar,Pathologie-biologie,57,2,188-96,,10.1016/j.patbio.2008.04.006,18511217,#865,Wild 2009,Exclusion reason: No report of parameters (including seroprevalance and other measures of interest) or transmission or historical outbreaks; ,Review paper

Nipah virus encephalitis outbreak in Malaysia.,Lam SK.; Chua KB.,"Emerging infectious diseases involving zoonosis have become important global health problems. The 1998 outbreak of severe febrile encephalitis among pig farmers in Malaysia caused by a newly emergent paramyxovirus, Nipah virus, is a good example.

"Spatial characterization of colonies of the flying fox bat, a carrier of Nipah virus in Thailand.",Thanapongtharm W.; Linard C.; Wiriyarat W.; Chinsorn P.; Kanchanasaka B.; Xiao X.; Biradar C.; Wallace RG.; Gilbert M.,"A major reservoir of Nipah virus is believed to be the flying fox genus Pteropus, a fruit bat distributed across many of the world's tropical and sub-tropical areas. The emergence of the virus and its zoonotic transmission to livestock and humans have been linked to losses in the bat's habitat. Nipah has been identified in a number of indigenous flying fox populations in Thailand. While no evidence of infection in domestic pigs or people has been found to date, pig farming is an active agricultural sector in Thailand and therefore could be a potential pathway for zoonotic disease transmission from the bat reservoirs. The disease, then, represents a potential zoonotic risk. To characterize the spatial habitat of flying fox populations along Thailand's Central Plain, and to map potential contact zones between flying fox habitats, pig farms and human settlements, we conducted field observation, remote sensing, and ecological niche modeling to characterize flying fox colonies and their ecological neighborhoods. A Potential Surface Analysis was applied to map contact zones among local epizootic actors. Flying fox colonies are found mainly on Thailand's Central Plain, particularly in locations surrounded by bodies of water, vegetation, and safe havens such as Buddhist temples. High-risk areas for Nipah zoonosis in pigs include the agricultural ring around the Bangkok metropolitan region where the density of pig farms is high. Passive and active surveillance programs should be prioritized around Bangkok, particularly on farms with low biosecurity, close to water, and/or on which orchards are concomitantly grown. Integration of human and animal health surveillance should be pursued in these same areas. Such proactive planning would help conserve flying fox colonies and should help prevent zoonotic transmission of Nipah and other pathogens.",2015,Mar,BMC veterinary research,11,,81,,10.1186/s12917-015-0390-0,25880385,#902,Thanapongtharm 2015,"Exclusion reason: No report of parameters (including seroprevalance and other measures of interest) or transmission or historical outbreaks; Sangeeta Bhatia (2019-08-29 21:51:46)(Select): Nice paper, table 3 could be useful.

Evidence of exposure to henipaviruses in domestic pigs in Uganda.,Atherstone C.; Diederich S.; Weingartl HM.; Fischer K.; Balkema-Buschmann A.; Grace D.; Alonso S.; Dhand NK.; Ward MP.; Mor SM.,"Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV), belonging to the genus Henipavirus, are among the most pathogenic of viruses in humans. Old World fruit bats (family Pteropodidae) are the natural reservoir hosts. Molecular and serological studies found evidence of henipavirus infection in fruit bats from several African countries. However, little is known about the potential for spillover into domestic animals in East Africa, particularly pigs, which served as amplifying hosts during the first outbreak of NiV in Malaysia and Singapore. We collected sera from 661 pigs presented for slaughter in Uganda between December 2015 and October 2016. Using HeV G and NiV G indirect ELISAs, 14 pigs (2%) were seroreactive in at least one ELISA. Seroprevalence increased to 5.4% in October 2016, when pigs were 9.5 times more likely to be seroreactive than pigs sampled in December 2015 (p = 0.04). Eight of the 14 ELISA-positive samples reacted with HeV N antigen in Western blot. None of the sera neutralized HeV or NiV in plaque reduction neutralization tests. Although we did not detect neutralizing antibodies, our results suggest that pigs in Uganda are exposed to henipaviruses or henipa-like viruses. Pigs in this study were sourced from many farms throughout Uganda, suggesting multiple (albeit rare) introductions of henipaviruses into the pig population. We postulate that given the widespread distribution of Old World fruit bats in Africa, spillover of henipaviruses from fruit bats to pigs in Uganda could result in exposure of pigs at multiple locations. A higher risk of a spillover event at the end of the dry season might be explained by higher densities of bats and contact with pigs at this time of the year, exacerbated by nutritional stress in bat populations and their reproductive cycle. Future studies should prioritize determining the risk of spillover of henipaviruses from pigs to people, so that potential risks can be mitigated.",2018,Dec,Transboundary and emerging diseases,,,,,10.1111/tbed.13105,30576076,#926,Atherstone 2018,Exclusion reason: No report of parameters (including seroprevalance and other measures of interest) or transmission or historical outbreaks; ,Seroprevalence in animals

Nipah encephalitis - an update.,Sherrini BA.; Chong TT.,"Between September 1998 to May 1999, Malaysia and Singapore were hit by an outbreak of fatal encephalitis caused by a novel virus from the paramyxovirus family. This virus was subsequently named as Nipah virus, after the Sungei Nipah village in Negeri Sembilan, where the virus was first isolated. The means of transmission was thought to be from bats-topigs and subsequently pigs-to-human. Since 2001, almost yearly outbreak of Nipah encephalitis has been reported from Bangladesh and West Bengal, India. These outbreaks were characterized by direct bats-to-human, and human-to-human spread of infection. Nipah virus shares many similar characteristics to Hendra virus, first isolated in an outbreak of respiratory illness involving horses in Australia in 1994. Because of their homology, a new genus called Henipavirus (Hendra + Nipah) was introduced. Henipavirus infection is a human disease manifesting most often as acute encephalitis (which may be relapsing or late-onset) or pneumonia, with a high mortality rate. Pteropus bats act as reservoir for the virus, which subsequently lead to human spread. Transmission may be from consumption of food contaminated by bats secretion, contact with infected animals, or human-to-human spread. With wide geographical distribution of Pteropus bats, Henipavirus infection has become an important emerging human infection with worldwide implication.",2014,Aug,The Medical journal of Malaysia,69 Suppl A,,103-11,,,25417957,#958,Sherrini 2014,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,""

The pandemic potential of Nipah virus.,Luby SP.,"Nipah virus, a paramyxovirus whose wildlife reservoir is Pteropus bats, was first discovered in a large outbreak of acute encephalitis in Malaysia in 1998 among persons who had contact with sick pigs. Apparently, one or more pigs was infected from bats, and the virus then spread efficiently from pig to pig, then from pigs to people. Nipah virus outbreaks have been recognized nearly every year in Bangladesh since 2001 and occasionally in neighboring India. Outbreaks in Bangladesh and India have been characterized by frequent person-to-person transmission and the death of over 70% of infected people. Characteristics of Nipah virus that increase its risk of becoming a global pandemic include: humans are already susceptible; many strains are capable of limited person-to-person transmission; as an RNA virus, it has an exceptionally high rate of mutation: and that if a human-adapted strain were to infect communities in South Asia, high population densities and global interconnectedness would rapidly spread the infection. Appropriate steps to estimate and manage this risk include studies to explore the molecular and genetic basis of respiratory transmission of henipaviruses, improved surveillance for human infections, support from high-income countries to reduce the risk of person-to-person transmission of infectious agents in low-income health care settings, and consideration of vaccination in communities at ongoing risk of exposure to the secretions and excretions of Pteropus bats.",2013,Oct,Antiviral research,100,1,38-43,,10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.07.011,23911335,#972,Luby 2013,Exclusion reason: Not peer-reviewed paper; Lorenzo Cattarino (2019-09-17 18:34:26)(Select): commentary - not pr; ,""

"Epidemiology, surveillance and control of Nipah virus infections in Malaysia.",Chua KB.,"The outbreak of Nipah virus, affecting pigs and pig-farm workers, was first noted in September 1998 in the north-western part of peninsular Malaysia. By March 1999, the outbreak had spread to other pig-farming areas of the country, inclusive of the neighbouring country, Singapore. A total of 283 human cases of viral encephalitis with 109 deaths were recorded in Malaysia from 29 September 1998 to December 1999. During the outbreak period, a number of surveillances under three broad groups; Surveillance in Human Health Sector, Surveillance in Animal Health Sector, and Surveillance for the Reservoir Hosts, were carried out to determine the prevalence, risk of virus infections and transmission in human and swine populations as well as the source and reservoir hosts of Nipah virus. Surveillance data showed that the virus spread rapidly among pigs within infected farms and transmission was attributed to direct contact with infective excretions and secretions. The spread of the virus among pig farms within and between states of peninsular Malaysia was due to movement of pigs. The transmission of the virus to humans was through close contact with infected pigs. Human to human transmission was considered a rare event though the Nipah virus could be isolated from saliva, urine, nasal and pharyngeal secretions of patients. Field investigations identified fruitbats of the Pteropid species as the natural reservoir hosts of the viruses.

"Risk factors, prevention and communication strategy during Nipah virus outbreak in Malaysia.",Chua KB.,"An outbreak of acute febrile encephalitis affecting pig-farm workers and owners was recognized in peninsular Malaysia as early as September 1998. The outbreak was initially thought to be due to Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus and thus very intensive prevention, control and communication strategies directed at JE virus were undertaken by the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Agriculture of Malaysia. There was an immediate change in the prevention, control and communication strategies with focus and strategies on infected pigs as the source of infections for humans and other animals following the discovery of Nipah virus. Information and understanding the risks of Nipah virus infections and modes of transmission strengthened the directions of prevention, control and communication strategies. A number of epidemiological surveillances and field investigations which were broadly divided into 3 groups covering human health sector, animal health sector and reservoir hosts were carried out as forms of risk assessment to determine and assess the factors and degree of risk of infections by the virus. Data showed that there was significant association between Nipah virus infection and performing activities involving close contact with pigs, such as processing of piglets, administering injection or medication to pigs, assisting in the birth of piglets, assisting in pig breeding, and handling of dead pigs in the affected farms. A complex process of anthropogenic driven deforestation, climatic changes brought on by El Niño-related drought, forest fire and severe haze, and ecological factors of mixed agro-pig farming practices and design of pig-sties led to the spillovers of the virus from its wildlife reservoir into pig population.",2010,Dec,The Malaysian journal of pathology,32,2,75-80,,,21329177,#1002,Chua 2010,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,""
Emerging trends of Nipah virus: A review.,Sharma V.; Kaushik S.; Kumar R.; Yadav JP.; Kaushik S.,"Since emergence of the Nipah virus (NiV) in 1998 from Malaysia, the NiV virus has reappeared on different occasions causing severe infections in human population associated with high rate of mortality. NiV has been placed along with Hendra virus in genus Henipavirus of family Paramyxoviridae. Fruit bats (Genus Pteropus) are known to be natural host and reservoir of NiV. During the outbreaks from Malaysia and Singapore, the roles of pigs as intermediate host were confirmed. The infection transmitted from bats to pigs and subsequently from pigs to humans. Severe encephalitis was reported in NiV infection often associated with neurological disorders. First NiV outbreak in India occurred in Siliguri district of West Bengal in 2001, where direct transmission of the NiV virus from bats-to-human and human-to-human was reported in contrast to the role of pigs in the Malaysian NiV outbreak. Regular NiV outbreaks have been reported from Bangladesh since 2001 to 2015. The latest outbreak of NiV has been recorded in May, 2018 from Kerala, India which resulted in the death of 17 individuals. Due to lack of vaccines and effective antivirals, Nipah encephalitis poses a great threat to public health. Routine surveillance studies in the infected areas can be useful in detecting early signs of infection and help in containment of these outbreaks.",2019,Jan,Reviews in medical virology,29,1,e2010,,10.1002/rmv.2010,30251294,#1003,Sharma 2019,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Lorenzo Cattarino (2019-09-17 18:43:51)(Select): parameters in table 1; ,Review paper

Transmission of human infection with Nipah virus.,Luby SP.; Gurley ES.; Hossain MJ.,"Nipah virus (NiV) is a paramyxovirus whose reservoir host is fruit bats of the genus Pteropus. Occasionally the virus is introduced into human populations and causes severe illness characterized by encephalitis or respiratory disease. The first outbreak of NiV was recognized in Malaysia, but 8 outbreaks have been reported from Bangladesh since 2001. The primary pathways of transmission from bats to people in Bangladesh are through contamination of raw date palm sap by bats with subsequent consumption by humans and through infection of domestic animals (cattle, pigs, and goats), presumably from consumption of food contaminated with bat saliva or urine with subsequent transmission to people. Approximately one-half of recognized Nipah case patients in Bangladesh developed their disease following person-to-person transmission of the virus. Efforts to prevent transmission should focus on decreasing bat access to date palm sap and reducing family members' and friends' exposure to infected patients' saliva.",2009,Dec,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,49,11,1743-8,,10.1086/647951,19886791,#1042,Luby 2009,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Joseph Hicks (2025-03-11 03:04:08)(Select): Review paper; ,""
Henipaviruses-unanswered questions of lethal zoonoses.,Field H.; Kung N.,"The highly lethal Hendra and Nipah viruses have been described for little more than a decade, yet within that time have been aetiologically associated with major livestock and human health impacts, albeit on a limited scale. Do these emerging pathogens pose a broader threat, or are they inconsequential 'viral chatter'. Given their lethality, and the evident multi-generational human-to-human transmission associated with Nipah virus in Bangladesh, it seems prudent to apply the precautionary principle. While much is known of their clinical, pathogenic and epidemiologic features in livestock species and humans, a number of fundamental questions regarding the relationship between the viruses, their natural fruit-bat host and the environment remain unanswered.

Re-emergence Nipah - a review.,Arif SM.; Basher A.; Quddus MR.; Faiz MA.,"There was an outbreak of new emergence viral encephalitis caused by Nipah virus among humans in some areas of Bangladesh during 2001 - till to date. The disease affected mainly the young, had increased suspicion to spread from bat to man through eating of the same fruits. The risk of human-to-human transmission is thought to be low though many of the affected individuals belonged to the same family. The disease presented mainly as acute encephalitis with usually a short incubation period of less than two weeks, with the main symptoms of fever, headache, and giddiness followed by coma. Distinctive clinical signs include areflexia, hypotonia, hypertension, tachycardia and segmental myoclonus. Serology was helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed distinctive changes of multiple, discrete or confluent small high signal lesions, best seen with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences. Mortality was as high as 32-92% and death was probably due to severe brainstem involvement. Relapse encephalitis was seen in those who recovered from acute encephalitis, and late-onset encephalitis was seen in those with initial non-encephalitic or asymptomatic diseases. Both these manifested as focal encephalitis arising from recurrent infection.",2012,Oct,Mymensingh medical journal : MMJ,21,4,772-9,,,23134935,#1063,Arif 2012,Exclusion reason: No report of parameters (including seroprevalance and other measures of interest) or transmission or historical outbreaks; ,Review paper

The immune response to Nipah virus infection.,Prescott J.; de Wit E.; Feldmann H.; Munster VJ.,"Nipah virus has recently emerged as a zoonotic agent that is highly pathogenic in humans. Outbreaks have occurred regularly over the last two decades in South and Southeast Asia, where mortality rates reach as high as 100 %. The natural reservoir of Nipah virus has been identified as bats from the Pteropus family, where infection is largely asymptomatic. Human disease is characterized by both respiratory and encephalitic components, and thus far, no effective vaccine or intervention strategies are available. Little is know about how the immune response of either the reservoir host or incidental hosts responds to infection, and how this immune response is either inadequate or might contribute to disease in the dead-end host. Experimental vaccines strategies have given us some insight into the immunological requirements for protection. This review summarizes our current understanding of the immune response to Nipah virus infection and emphasizes the need for further research.",2012,Sep,Archives of virology,157,9,1635-41,,10.1007/s00705-012-1352-5,22669317,#1116,Prescott 2012,Exclusion reason: No report of parameters (including seroprevalance and other measures of interest) or transmission or historical outbreaks; ,Review paper; Seroprevalence in animals; immunology

Lessons from the Nipah virus outbreak in Malaysia.,Looi LM.; Chua KB.,"The Nipah virus outbreak in Malaysia (September 1998 to May 1999) resulted in 265 cases of acute encephalitis with 105 deaths, and near collapse of the billion-dollar pig-farming industry. Because it was initially attributed to Japanese encephalitis, early control measures were ineffective, and the outbreak spread to other parts of Malaysia and nearby Singapore. The isolation of the novel aetiological agent, the Nipah virus (NiV), from the cerebrospinal fluid of an outbreak victim was the turning point which led to outbreak control 2 months later. Together with the Hendra virus, NiV is now recognised as a new genus, Henipavirus (Hendra + Nipah), in the Paramyxoviridae family. Efforts of the local and international scientific community have since elucidated the epidemiology, clinico-pathophysiology and pathogenesis of this new disease. Humans contracted the infection from close contact with infected pigs, and formed the basis for pig-culling that eventually stopped the outbreak. NiV targeted medium-sized and small blood vessels resulting in endothelial multinucleated syncytia and fibrinoid necrosis. Autopsies revealed disseminated cerebral microinfarctions resulting from vasculitis-induced thrombosis and direct neuronal involvement. The discovery of NiV in the urine and saliva of Malaysian Island flying foxes (Pteropus hypomelanus and Petropus vampyrus) implicated these as natural reservoir hosts of NiV. It is probable that initial transmission of NiV from bats to pigs occurred in late 1997/early 1998 through contamination of pig swill by bat excretions, as a result of migration of these forest fruitbats to cultivated orchards and pig-farms, driven by fruiting failure of forest trees during the El Nino-related drought and anthropogenic fires in Indonesia in 1997-1998. This outbreak emphasizes the need for sharing information of any unusual illnesses in animals and humans, an open-minded approach and close collaboration and co-ordination between the medical profession, veterinarians and wildlife specialists in the investigation of such illnesses. Environmental mismanagement (such as deforestation and haze) has far-reaching effects, including encroachment of wildlife into human habitats and the introduction of zoonotic infections into domestic animals and humans.",2007,Dec,The Malaysian journal of pathology,29,2,63-7,,,19108397,#1127,Looi 2007,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Joseph Hicks (2025-03-14 02:43:58)(Included): Review; outbreak numbers cited from other peer-reviewed papers; Sangeeta Bhatia (2019-08-28 21:49:35)(Select): Malaysian outbreak summarised; ,""

"Nipah virus epidemic in southern India and emphasizing ""One Health"" approach to ensure global health security.",Chattu VK.; Kumar R.; Kumary S.; Kajal F.; David JK.,"Nipah virus (NiV) encephalitis first reported in ""Sungai Nipah"" in Malaysia in 1999 has emerged as a global public health threat in the Southeast Asia region. From 1998 to 2018, more than 630 cases of NiV human infections were reported. NiV is transmitted by zoonotic (from bats to humans, or from bats to pigs, and then to humans) as well as human-to-human routes. Deforestation and urbanization of some areas have contributed to greater overlap between human and bat habitats resulting in NiV outbreaks. Common symptoms of NiV infection in humans are similar to that of influenza such as fever and muscle pain and in some cases, the inflammation of the brain occurs leading to encephalitis. The recent epidemic in May 2018 in Kerala for the first time has killed over 17 people in 7 days with high case fatality and highlighted the importance of One Health approach. The diagnosis is often not suspected at the time of presentation and creates challenges in outbreak detection, timely control measures, and outbreak response activities. Currently, there are no drugs or vaccines specific for NiV infection although this is a priority disease on the World Health Organization's agenda.

It was first identified 20 years ago in Malaysia and has since caused outbreaks in other parts of South and Southeast Asia. It causes severe neurological and respiratory disease which is highly lethal. It is highly infectious and spreads in the community through infected animals or other infected people. Different strains of the virus show differing clinical and epidemiological features. Rapid diagnosis and implementation of infection control measures are essential to contain outbreaks. A number of serological and molecular diagnostic techniques have been developed for diagnosis and surveillance. Difficulties in diagnosis and management arise when a new area is affected. The high mortality associated with infection and the possibility of spread to new areas has underscored the need for effective management and control. However, no effective treatment or prophylaxis is readily available, though several approaches show promise. Given the common chains of transmission from bats to humans, a One Health approach is necessary for the prevention and control of NiV infection.",2019,Jan,Epidemiol Infect,147,,e95,,10.1017/S0950268819000086,30869046,#2676,Aditi 2019,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper

Pathogenicity and virulence of henipaviruses.,Kaza B; Aguilar HC,"Paramyxoviruses are a family of single-stranded negative-sense RNA viruses, many of which are responsible for a range of respiratory and neurological diseases in humans and animals. Among the most notable are the henipaviruses, which include the deadly Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses, the causative agents of outbreaks of severe disease and high case fatality rates in humans and animals. NiV and HeV are maintained in fruit bat reservoirs primarily in the family Pteropus and spillover into humans directly or by an intermediate amplifying host such as swine or horses. Recently, non-chiropteran associated Langya (LayV), Gamak (GAKV), and Mojiang (MojV) viruses have been discovered with confirmed or suspected ability to cause disease in humans or animals. These viruses are less genetically related to HeV and NiV yet share many features with their better-known counterparts. Recent advances in surveillance of wild animal reservoir viruses have revealed a high number of henipaviral genome sequences distributed across most continents, and mammalian orders previously unknown to harbour henipaviruses. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the range of pathogenesis observed for the henipaviruses as well as their replication cycle, epidemiology, genomics, and host responses.

Three NiV strains NiV-Malaysia (NiV(M) ), NiV Bangladesh (NiV(B) ), and NiV India (NiV(I) reported in 2019) have been circulating in South-Asian nations. Sporadic outbreak observed in South-East Asian countries but human to human transmission raises the concern about its pandemic potential. The presence of the viral genome in reservoir bats has further confirmed that NiV has spread to the African and Australian continents. NiV research activities have gained momentum to achieve specific preparedness goals to meet any future emergency-as a result, several potential vaccine candidates have been developed and tested in a variety of animal models. Some of these candidate vaccines have entered further clinical trials. Research activities related to the discovery of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have resulted in the identification of a handful of candidates capable of neutralizing the virion. However, progress in discovering potential antiviral drugs has been limited.

We reviewed the available data on sequelae and persisting symptoms following infectious encephalitis with the aim of characterizing the clinical picture of these patients at months to years after hospitalization. We searched PubMed for case series involving sequelae after infectious encephalitis. We carried out a narrative review of the literature on encephalitis caused by members of the Herpesviridae family (herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, and human herpesvirus-6), members of the Flaviviridae family (West Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus), alphaviruses, and Nipah virus. We retrieved 41 studies that yielded original data involving 3,072 adult patients evaluated after infectious encephalitis. At least one of the five domains of cognitive outcome, psychiatric disorders, neurological deficits, global functioning, and quality of life was investigated in the reviewed studies. Various tests were used in the 41 studies and the investigation took place at different times after hospital discharge. The results showed that most patients are discharged with impairments, with frequent deficits in cognitive function such as memory loss or attention disorders. Sequelae tend to improve within several years following flavivirus or Nipah virus infection, but long-term data are scarce for other pathogens.

Severe zoonotic viruses carried by different species of bats and their regional distribution.,Liu Z; Liu Q; Wang H; Yao X,"BACKGROUND: Bats have garnered increased attention in the field of life sciences for their typical biological characteristics of carrying a variety of zoonotic viruses without disease, long lifespans, low tumorigenesis rates, and high metabolism. When it was found that bats can carry the rabies virus, over 60 years of research revealed that bats host over 4100 distinct viruses, including Ebola virus and SARS-CoV. OBJECTIVES: This paper primarily reviews the profiles of zoonotic viruses carried by bats across various regions globally. The review aims to provide a foundation and reference for future research on monitoring zoonotic viruses in diverse global regions and bat species, exploring the coevolutionary relationship between bats and viruses, understanding the tolerance mechanisms of bat B cells, prevention, and treatment of zoonotic diseases caused by bats. SOURCES: The search used 'bat', 'bats', 'rabies virus', 'Dengue virus', 'West Nile virus', 'Zika virus', 'St. Louis encephalitis virus', 'Japanese encephalitis virus', 'Hantavirus', 'Novel hantavirus', 'Rift Valley fever virus', 'Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus', 'Paramyxovirus', 'Nipah virus', 'Hendra virus', 'Menangle virus', 'Tioman virus', 'Marburg Virus', 'Bombali virus', 'Ebola virus', 'Influenza A virus', 'coronavirus', 'Hepatitis B virus', and 'Hepatitis E virus' as text in PubMed.

The Immunobiology of Nipah Virus.,Liew YJM; Ibrahim PAS; Ong HM; Chong CN; Tan CT; Schee JP; Gómez Román R; Cherian NG; Wong WF; Chang LY,"Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly lethal zoonotic paramyxovirus that emerged in Malaysia in 1998. It is a human pathogen capable of causing severe respiratory infection and encephalitis. The natural reservoir of NiV, Pteropus fruit bats, remains a continuous virus source for future outbreaks, although infection in the bats is largely asymptomatic. NiV provokes serious disease in various mammalian species. In the recent human NiV outbreaks in Bangladesh and India, both bats-to-human and human-to-human transmissions have been observed. NiV has been demonstrated to interfere with the innate immune response via interferon type I signaling, promoting viral dissemination and preventing antiviral response. Studies of humoral immunity in infected NiV patients and animal models have shown that NiV-specific antibodies were produced upon infection and were protective. Studies on cellular immunity response to NiV infection in human and animal models also found that the adaptive immune response, specifically CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, was stimulated upon NiV infection. The experimental vaccines and therapeutic strategies developed have provided insights into the immunological requirements for the development of successful medical countermeasures against NiV.

"Henipavirus zoonosis: outbreaks, animal hosts and potential new emergence.",Li H; Kim JV; Pickering BS,"Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) are biosafety level 4 zoonotic pathogens causing severe and often fatal neurological and respiratory disease. These agents have been recognized by the World Health Organization as top priority pathogens expected to result in severe future outbreaks. HeV has caused sporadic infections in horses and a small number of human cases in Australia since 1994. The NiV Malaysia genotype (NiV-M) was responsible for the 1998-1999 epizootic outbreak in pigs with spillover to humans in Malaysia and Singapore. Since 2001, the NiV Bangladesh genotype (NiV-B) has been the predominant strain leading to outbreaks almost every year in Bangladesh and India, with hundreds of infections in humans. The natural reservoir hosts of HeV and NiV are fruit bats, which carry the viruses without clinical manifestation. The transmission pathways of henipaviruses from bats to humans remain poorly understood. Transmissions are often bridged by an intermediate animal host, which amplifies and spreads the viruses to humans. Horses and pigs are known intermediate hosts for the HeV outbreaks in Australia and NiV-M epidemic in Malaysia and Singapore, respectively. During the NiV-B outbreaks in Bangladesh, following initial spillover thought to be through the consumption of date palm sap, the spread of infection was largely human-to-human transmission. Spillover of NiV-B in recent outbreaks in India is less understood, with the primary route of transmission from bat reservoir to the initial human infection case(s) unknown and no intermediate host established. This review aims to provide a concise update on the epidemiology of henipaviruses covering their previous and current outbreaks with emphasis on the known and potential role of livestock as intermediate hosts in disease transmission.

RESULTS: We report the presence of neutralizing antibodies against henipavirus lineage GH-M74a virus (odds ratio 6.23; p < 0.001), Nipah virus (odds ratio 4.04; p = 0.00031), bat influenza H17N10 virus (odds ratio 7.25; p < 0.001) and no significant association with Ebola virus (odds ratio 0.56; p = 0.375) in this bat cohort. CONCLUSION: The data suggest a potential risk of zoonotic spillover including the possible circulation of highly pathogenic viruses in E. helvum populations. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining sero-surveillance of E. helvum, and the necessity for further, more comprehensive investigations to monitor changes in virus prevalence, distribution over time, and across different geographic locations.",2023,,Front Public Health,11,,1283113,,10.3389/fpubh.2023.1283113,38106901,#2733,Cantoni 2023,Exclusion reason: No report of parameters (including seroprevalance and other measures of interest) or transmission or historical outbreaks; Tristan Naidoo (2024-10-26 20:32:14)(Screen): Worth capturing spillover risk?; ,""
"Immune correlates of protection for SARS-CoV-2, Ebola and Nipah virus infection.",Escudero-Pérez B; Lawrence P; Castillo-Olivares J,"Correlates of protection (CoP) are biological parameters that predict a certain level of protection against an infectious disease. Well-established correlates of protection facilitate the development and licensing of vaccines by assessing protective efficacy without the need to expose clinical trial participants to the infectious agent against which the vaccine aims to protect. Despite the fact that viruses have many features in common, correlates of protection can vary considerably amongst the same virus family and even amongst a same virus depending on the infection phase that is under consideration. Moreover, the complex interplay between the various immune cell populations that interact during infection and the high degree of genetic variation of certain pathogens, renders the identification of immune correlates of protection difficult. Some emerging and re-emerging viruses of high consequence for public health such as SARS-CoV-2, Nipah virus (NiV) and Ebola virus (EBOV) are especially challenging with regards to the identification of CoP since these pathogens have been shown to dysregulate the immune response during infection. Whereas, virus neutralising antibodies and polyfunctional T-cell responses have been shown to correlate with certain levels of protection against SARS-CoV-2, EBOV and NiV, other effector mechanisms of immunity play important roles in shaping the immune response against these pathogens, which in turn might serve as alternative correlates of protection. This review describes the different components of the adaptive and innate immune system that are activated during SARS-CoV-2, EBOV and NiV infections and that may contribute to protection and virus clearance. Overall, we highlight the immune signatures that are associated with protection against these pathogens in humans and could be used as CoP.",2023,,Front Immunol,14,,1156758,,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1156758,37153606,#2737,Escudero-Pérez 2023,Exclusion reason: No report of parameters (including seroprevalance and other measures of interest) or transmission or historical outbreaks; ,""
Infection and transmission of henipavirus in animals.,Qiu X; Wang F; Sha A,"Henipavirus (HNV) is well known for two zoonotic viruses in the genus, Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV), which pose serious threat to human and animal health. In August 2022, a third zoonotic virus in the genus Henipavirus, Langya virus (LayV), was discovered in China. The emergence of HeV, NiV, and LayV highlights the persistent threat of HNV to human and animal health. In addition to the above three HNVs, new species within this genus are still being discovered. Although they have not yet caused a pandemic in humans or livestock, they still have the risk of spillover as a potential threat to the health of humans and animals. It's important to understand the infection and transmission of different HNV in animals for the prevention and control of current or future HNV epidemics. Therefore, this review mainly summarizes the animal origin, animal infection and transmission of HNV that have been found worldwide, and further analyzes and summarizes the rules of infection and transmission, so as to provide a reference for relevant scientific researchers. Furthermore, it can provide a direction for epidemic prevention and control, and animal surveillance to reduce the risk of the global pandemic of HNV.",2024,Jun,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,109,,102183,,10.1016/j.cimid.2024.102183,38640700,#2739,Qiu 2024,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper
"Molecular, ecological, and behavioral drivers of the bat-virus relationship.",Gonzalez V; Banerjee A,"Bats perform important ecological roles in our ecosystem. However, recent studies have demonstrated that bats are reservoirs of emerging viruses that have spilled over into humans and agricultural animals to cause severe diseases. These viruses include Hendra and Nipah paramyxoviruses, Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, and coronaviruses that are closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. Intriguingly, bats that are naturally or experimentally infected with these viruses do not show clinical signs of disease. Here we have reviewed ecological, behavioral, and molecular factors that may influence the ability of bats to harbor viruses.

Henipavirus infection of the central nervous system.,Dawes BE; Freiberg AN,"Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus are highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses of the genus Henipavirus, family Paramyxoviridae. These viruses were first identified as the causative agents of severe respiratory and encephalitic disease in the 1990s across Australia and Southern Asia with mortality rates reaching up to 75%. While outbreaks of Nipah and Hendra virus infections remain rare and sporadic, there is concern that NiV has pandemic potential. Despite increased attention, little is understood about the neuropathogenesis of henipavirus infection. Neuropathogenesis appears to arise from dual mechanisms of vascular disease and direct parenchymal brain infection, but the relative contributions remain unknown while respiratory disease arises from vasculitis and respiratory epithelial cell infection. This review will address NiV basic clinical disease, pathology and pathogenesis with a particular focus on central nervous system (CNS) infection and address the necessity of a model of relapsed CNS infection.

Ocular manifestations of emerging viral diseases.,Venkatesh A; Patel R; Goyal S; Rajaratnam T; Sharma A; Hossain P,"Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are an increasing threat to public health on a global scale. In recent times, the most prominent outbreaks have constituted RNA viruses, spreading via droplets (COVID-19 and Influenza A H1N1), directly between humans (Ebola and Marburg), via arthropod vectors (Dengue, Zika, West Nile, Chikungunya, Crimean Congo) and zoonotically (Lassa fever, Nipah, Rift Valley fever, Hantaviruses). However, specific approved antiviral therapies and vaccine availability are scarce, and public health measures remain critical. Patients can present with a spectrum of ocular manifestations. Emerging infectious diseases should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of ocular inflammatory conditions in patients inhabiting or returning from endemic territories, and more general vigilance is advisable in the context of a global pandemic.

Nipah Virus: An Overview of the Current Status of Diagnostics and Their Role in Preparedness in Endemic Countries.,Garbuglia AR; Lapa D; Pauciullo S; Raoul H; Pannetier D,"Nipah virus (NiV) is a paramyxovirus responsible for a high mortality rate zoonosis. As a result, it has been included in the list of Blueprint priority pathogens. Bats are the main reservoirs of the virus, and different clinical courses have been described in humans. The Bangladesh strain (NiV-B) is often associated with severe respiratory disease, whereas the Malaysian strain (NiV-M) is often associated with severe encephalitis. An early diagnosis of NiV infection is crucial to limit the outbreak and to provide appropriate care to the patient. Due to high specificity and sensitivity, qRT-PCR is currently considered to be the optimum method in acute NiV infection assessment. Nasal swabs, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and blood are used for RT-PCR testing. N gene represents the main target used in molecular assays. Different sensitivities have been observed depending on the platform used: real-time PCR showed a sensitivity of about 103 equivalent copies/reaction, SYBRGREEN technology's sensitivity was about 20 equivalent copies/reaction, and in multiple pathogen card arrays, the lowest limit of detection (LOD) was estimated to be 54 equivalent copies/reaction. An international standard for NiV is yet to be established, making it difficult to compare the sensitivity of the different methods. Serological assays are for the most part used in seroprevalence studies owing to their lower sensitivity in acute infection. Due to the high epidemic and pandemic potential of this virus, the diagnosis of NiV should be included in a more global One Health approach to improve surveillance and preparedness for the benefit of public health. Some steps need to be conducted in the diagnostic field in order to become more efficient in epidemic management, such as development of point-of-care (PoC) assays for the rapid diagnosis of NiV.",2023,Oct,Viruses,15,10,,,10.3390/v15102062,37896839,#2747,Garbuglia 2023,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper

Advancing the frontiers: Revolutionary control and prevention paradigms against Nipah virus.,Orosco FL,"Nipah Virus (NiV) is a highly virulent pathogen that poses a significant threat to human and animal populations. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest control and prevention strategies against NiV, focusing on vaccine development, antiviral drug discovery, early diagnosis, surveillance, and high-level biosecurity measures. Advancements in vaccine research, including live-attenuated vaccines, virus-like particles, and mRNA-based vaccines, hold promise for preventing NiV infections. In addition, antiviral drugs, such as remdesivir, ribavirin, and favipiravir, have the potential to inhibit NiV replication. Early diagnosis through molecular and serological assays, immunohistochemistry, and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction plays a crucial role in timely detection. Surveillance efforts encompassing cluster-based and case-based systems enhance outbreak identification and provide valuable insights into transmission dynamics. Furthermore, the implementation of high-level biosecurity measures in agriculture, livestock practices, and healthcare settings is essential to minimize transmission risks.

Major zoonotic diseases of public health importance in Bangladesh.,Chowdhury S; Aleem MA; Khan MSI; Hossain ME; Ghosh S; Rahman MZ,"Zoonotic diseases cause repeated outbreaks in humans globally. The majority of emerging infections in humans are zoonotic. COVID-19 is an ideal example of a recently identified emerging zoonotic disease, causing a global pandemic. Anthropogenic factors such as modernisation of agriculture and livestock farming, wildlife hunting, the destruction of wild animal habitats, mixing wild and domestic animals, wildlife trading, changing food habits and urbanisation could drive the emergence of zoonotic diseases in humans. Since 2001, Bangladesh has been reporting many emerging zoonotic disease outbreaks such as nipah, highly pathogenic avian influenza, pandemic H1N1, and COVID-19. There are many other potential zoonotic pathogens such as Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Kyasanur forest disease virus and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever that may emerge in the future. However, we have a limited understanding of zoonotic diseases' overall risk in humans and associated factors that drive the emergence of zoonotic pathogens. This narrative review summarised the major emerging, re-emerging, neglected and other potential zoonotic diseases in Bangladesh and their associated risk factors. Nipah virus and Bacillus anthracis caused repeated outbreaks in humans. More than 300 human cases with Nipah virus infection were reported since the first outbreak in 2001. The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) caused more than 550 outbreaks in poultry, and eight human cases were reported so far since 2007. People of Bangladesh are frequently exposed to zoonotic pathogens due to close interaction with domestic and peri-domestic animals. The rapidly changing intensified animal-human-ecosystem interfaces and risky practices increase the risk of zoonotic disease transmission. The narrative review's findings are useful to draw attention to the risk and emergence of zoonotic diseases to public health policymakers in Bangladesh and the application of one-health approach to address this public health threat.",2021,Jul,Vet Med Sci,7,4,1199-1210,,10.1002/vms3.465,33650812,#2756,Chowdhury 2021,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper

Here, we review the dose-response literature and discuss the unique role dose-response models have to play in understanding and predicting spillover events. We present a re-analysis of dose-response experiments for two important zoonotic pathogens (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Nipah virus), to exemplify potential difficulties in differentiating between appropriate models with small exposure experiment datasets. We also discuss the data requirements needed for robust selection between dose-response models.

However, knowledge of the potential geographical extent and risk patterns of the virus is poor. We aimed to establish an integrated spatiotemporal and phylogenetic database of Nipah virus infections in humans and animals across south and southeast Asia. METHODS: In this geospatial modelling analysis, we developed an integrated database containing information on the distribution of Nipah virus infections in humans and animals from 1998 to 2021. We conducted phylodynamic analysis to examine the evolution and migration pathways of the virus and meta-analyses to estimate the adjusted case-fatality rate. We used two boosted regression tree models to identify the potential ecological drivers of Nipah virus occurrences in spillover events and endemic areas, and mapped potential risk areas for Nipah virus endemicity. FINDINGS: 749 people and eight bat species across nine countries were documented as being infected with Nipah virus. On the basis of 66 complete genomes of the virus, we identified two clades-the Bangladesh clade and the Malaysia clade-with the time of the most recent common ancestor estimated to be 1863. Adjusted case-fatality rates varied widely between countries and were higher for the Bangladesh clade than for the Malaysia clade. Multivariable meta-regression analysis revealed significant relationships between case-fatality rate estimates and viral clade (p=0·0021), source country (p=0·016), proportion of male patients (p=0·036), and travel time to health-care facilities (p=0·036). Temperature-related bioclimate variables and the probability of occurrence of Pteropus medius were important contributors to both the spillover and the endemic infection models. INTERPRETATION: The suitable niches for Nipah virus are more extensive than previously reported. Future surveillance efforts should focus on high-risk areas informed by updated projections. Specifically, intensifying zoonotic surveillance efforts, enhancing laboratory testing capacity, and implementing public health education in projected high-risk areas where no human cases have been reported to date will be crucial.

NiV is a biosafety-level-4 pathogen that is mostly spread by Pteropus species, which serve as its natural reservoir host. NiV is one of the major public health challenges in South and South East Asia. However, few molecular studies have been conducted to characterise NiV in a specific region. The main objective of this review is to understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, molecular surveillance, transmission dynamics, genetic diversity, reservoir host, clinical characteristics, and phylogenetics of NiV. South and South East Asian nations have experienced NiV outbreaks. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that two primary clades of NiV are in circulation.

Nipah Virus Disease: Recent Perspective and One Health Approach.,Singhai M; Jain R; Jain S; Bala M; Singh S; Goyal R,"BACKGROUND: Nipah virus (NiV) first emerged in 1998 in Malaysia, causing an outbreak of respiratory illness and encephalitis in pigs. Pig-to-human transmission of NiV associated with severe febrile encephalitis was described, and it was thought to occur through close contact with infected animals. The first outbreak was reported in India in Siliguri, West Bengal in 2001 followed by Nadia, West Bengal and adjoining areas of Bangladesh in 2007, where an intermediate animal host was not identified, suggesting bat-to-human and human-to-human transmissions. Although it is extremely difficult to document the spillover event and ascertain crossing of trans-natural boundaries by bats and bringing new viruses in an unexposed population, efforts for source identification are important to understand the epidemiology of disease. As the disease transcends beyond one species and has shown to infect humans, it therefore requires the 'One Health approach' in which multiple sectors coordinate and work together to achieve better public health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: We summarize the re-emergence and response of the Nipah virus outbreaks (NiVD) in Kerala, India, about 1800 kms away, a decade later in 2018 and 2019. The paper recapitulates involvement of various stakeholders from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Directorate of Health Research, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, State Health Department, State Animal Husbandry, District Administration, and multidisciplinary response mechanism during the NiVD outbreaks of 2018 and 2019. METHODS: Information was collected from the Press Information Bureau (PIB), media/weekly alerts from the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), news articles from print and electronic media, newsletters, advisories from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Disease Outbreak News (DON), World Health Organization (WHO), and published papers from various stakeholders. FINDINGS & CONCLUSION: The evidence of NiV in humans and bats, with samples collected from the outbreak sites, was laboratory confirmed. The multidisciplinary response mechanisms during the 2018 outbreak helped in further understanding the importance of the One Health approach for systemic and streamlined response utilizing existing surveillance systems. This was of utmost help in the subsequent outbreak of the disease that occurred during 2019, wherein there was no documented spread of disease from the index case and no mortality was observed. This success reiterates the need for institutionalizing the involvement and cooperation of various departments and organizations during public health emergencies, especially of Zoonotic diseases, using the One Health approach.",2021,,Ann Glob Health,87,1,102,,10.5334/aogh.3431,34712599,#2793,Singhai 2021,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,One health; Review paper
Nipah virus: a narrative review of viral characteristics and epidemiological determinants.,Sayed A; Bottu A; Qaisar M; Mane MP; Acharya Y,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this article are to highlight the properties of the Nipah virus (NiV) and discuss its epidemiological determinants. STUDY DESIGN: A review of conjectures, epidemiological and clinically related studies, and identification and discussion of preventive approaches is conducted. METHODS: A review of the current literature is performed going through online search engines: PubMed and Google Scholar. The search strategy was focused on two main components, first on the NiV ('Nipah' OR 'Nipah Virus') and subsequently on its epidemiology, including determinants and preventive measures ('Epidemiology/determinants' OR 'Epidemiology/prevention'). RESULTS: NiV infection is an emerging zoonotic infectious disease causing sporadic outbursts in many developing countries within Asia, Africa, and South America. Pteroid bats are the natural reservoirs, but human-to-human transmission is possible. Clinical course ranges from non-specific influenza-like symptoms to rapidly progressive respiratory and neurologic complications. Vector control has been challenging because of its widely distributed ecological niche. Currently, no definitive treatment protocols are available in humans, but profound breakthrough in vaccine technology and successful equine vaccines has shown the way for the development of NiV vaccine and immunization in the near future. CONCLUSIONS: The NiV poses a significant public health risk because of its intricate transmission cycle, unpredictable viral course, murky management protocol, and unavailability of vaccine. Complicated by emergence and subsequent reemergence, prevention and containment are the two most important public health promotion strategies. Early anticipation, intergovernmental preparedness and cooperation, and surveillance of zoonotic infections still remain the key to mitigate the risk.",2019,Aug,Public Health,173,,97-104,,10.1016/j.puhe.2019.05.019,31261032,#2795,Sayed 2019,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper
"Nipah amidst Covid-19 Pandemic, another Re-Emerging Infectious Disease of Pandemic Potential - a Narrative Review.",Kaliappan A; Kaliappan V; Lakshmi JT; Raja S; Nikhat SS; Vidya MS; Saranya M; Sagar T; Chenna KD,"Introduction: Nipah virus (NiV) was reported for the first time from the Kampung Sungai Nipah village of Malaysia in 1998. Since then, there have been multiple outbreaks, all of them in South- and South-East Asia. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), up to 75% of Nipah infections were proven to be fatal. Nipah virus belongs to the group of Biosafety Level-4 pathogen associated with high case fatality rate (40-75%). Methodology:According to the PRISMA guidelines for 2020, we searched in four medical databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE and Scopus) and selected relevant studies from the past twenty years till November 2021. Review:Nipah virus was first detected in Malaysia's Kampung Sungai Nipah in 1998. By May 1999, the Malaysia Ministry of Health in association with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported a total of 258 cases with a case fatality rate of almost 40%. Nipah in Kozhikode:Experts from the Pune Institute and Bhopal's National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases had collected Bat samples from Pazhoor in Chathamangalam gram panchayat (where a 12-year-old died due to Nipah infection on September 5 carried antibodies of the virus). All Indian outbreaks have seen person-to-person transmission. The virus found in Kerala differed from those two variants in terms of genetic structure. It also differed by 1.96% from the Bangladesh variant. The difference with the Malaysian variant was 8.42%. While PCR is the most sensitive technique for diagnosing active NiV infection, NiV-specific IgM ELISA offers a serological option when PCR is not available.

A Survey of Henipavirus Tropism-Our Current Understanding from a Species/Organ and Cellular Level.,Diederich S; Babiuk S; Boshra H,"Henipaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses that have been shown to be virulent in several species, including humans, pigs, horses, and rodents. Isolated nearly 30 years ago, these viruses have been shown to be of particular concern to public health, as at least two members (Nipah and Hendra viruses) are highly virulent, as well as zoonotic, and are thus classified as BSL4 pathogens. Although only 5 members of this genus have been isolated and characterized, metagenomics analysis using animal fluids and tissues has demonstrated the existence of other novel henipaviruses, suggesting a far greater degree of phylogenetic diversity than is currently known. Using a variety of molecular biology techniques, it has been shown that these viruses exhibit varying degrees of tropism on a species, organ/tissue, and cellular level. This review will attempt to provide a general overview of our current understanding of henipaviruses, with a particular emphasis on viral tropism.",2023,Oct,Viruses,15,10,,,10.3390/v15102048,37896825,#2802,Diederich 2023,"Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Tristan Naidoo (2024-10-27 01:02:29)(Screen): Has a review of the ""currently Well-Characterized Henipaviruses""; ",Review paper

We did a qualitative review of 53 infectious diseases in terrestrial animals with data from DISCONTOOLS, a specialist database and prioritisation model focusing on research gaps for improving infectious disease control in animals. Many diseases do not have any appropriate control tools, but the prioritisation model suggests that we should focus international efforts on Nipah virus infection, African swine fever, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, peste des petits ruminants, sheeppox and goatpox, avian influenza, Rift Valley fever, foot and mouth disease, and bovine tuberculosis, for the greatest impact on the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.

Henipavirus Immune Evasion and Pathogenesis Mechanisms: Lessons Learnt from Natural Infection and Animal Models.,Lawrence P; Escudero-Pérez B,"Nipah henipavirus (NiV) and Hendra henipavirus (HeV) are zoonotic emerging paramyxoviruses causing severe disease outbreaks in humans and livestock, mostly in Australia, India, Malaysia, Singapore and Bangladesh. Both are bat-borne viruses and in humans, their mortality rates can reach 60% in the case of HeV and 92% for NiV, thus being two of the deadliest viruses known for humans. Several factors, including a large cellular tropism and a wide zoonotic potential, con-tribute to their high pathogenicity. This review provides an overview of HeV and NiV pathogenicity mechanisms and provides a summary of their interactions with the immune systems of their different host species, including their natural hosts bats, spillover-hosts pigs, horses, and humans, as well as in experimental animal models.

Data on the involvement of several potential risk factors in Nipah virus transmission remain controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the pooled CFR of NiV encephalitis and to assess the risk factors for NiV infection. METHODS: Articles published up to the 27(th)of November 2018 in MedLine, Embase and Web of knowledge databases were considered for this study. We included cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control studies that have reported NiV CFR and/or risk factors. Data were pooled with random-effects model.

World Health Organization High Priority Pathogens: Ophthalmic Disease Findings and Vision Health Perspectives.,Kuthyar S; Anthony CL; Fashina T; Yeh S; Shantha JG,"Recent Ebola epidemics, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and emerging infectious disease threats have highlighted the importance of global infectious diseases and responses to public health emergencies. Ophthalmologists are essential health care workers who provide urgent and emergent vision care services during outbreaks and address the ocular consequences of epidemic and pandemic infectious diseases. In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) identified high priority pathogens likely to cause a future epidemic with the goal of guiding research and development to improve diagnostic tests, vaccines, and medicines. These measures were necessary to better inform and respond to public health emergencies. Given the ocular complications associated with emerging infectious diseases, there is a need to recognize the ophthalmic sequelae for future vision health preparedness for potential future outbreaks. The WHO High Priority pathogens list provides a roadmap for ophthalmologists and subspecialty providers that will guide strategic areas of research for clinical care and preparedness for future pandemic threats.

"Nipah shell disorder, modes of infection, and virulence.",Goh GK; Dunker AK; Foster JA; Uversky VN,"The Nipah Virus (NiV) was first isolated during a 1998-9 outbreak in Malaysia. The outbreak initially infected farm pigs and then moved to humans from pigs with a case-fatality rate (CFR) of about 40%. After 2001, regular outbreaks occurred with higher CFRs (~71%, 2001-5, ~93%, 2008-12). The spread arose from drinking virus-laden palm date sap and human-to-human transmission. Intrinsic disorder analysis revealed strong correlation between the percentage of disorder in the N protein and CFR (Regression: r(2) = 0.93, p < 0.01, ANOVA: p < 0.01). Distinct disorder and, therefore, genetic differences can be found in all three group of strains. The fact that the transmission modes of the Malaysia strain are different from those of the Bangladesh strains suggests that the correlations may also be linked to the modes of viral transmission. Analysis of the NiV and related viruses suggests links between modes of transmission and disorder of not just the N protein but, also, of M shell protein. The links among shell disorder, transmission modes, and virulence suggest mechanisms by which viruses are attenuated as they passed through different cell hosts from different animal species.

The primary objective is to perform a comparative analysis of mortality rates across different timelines and countries. Articles reporting NiV mortality from inception to November 2023 were analyzed in PubMed, Ovid Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases.

Major bat-borne zoonotic viral epidemics in Asia and Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Khan SA; Imtiaz MA; Islam MM; Tanzin AZ; Islam A; Hassan MM,"Bats are the natural reservoir host for many pathogenic and non-pathogenic viruses, potentially spilling over to humans and domestic animals directly or via an intermediate host. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is the continuation of virus spillover events that have taken place over the last few decades, particularly in Asia and Africa. Therefore, these bat-associated epidemics provide a significant number of hints, including respiratory cellular tropism, more intense susceptibility to these cell types, and overall likely to become a pandemic for the next spillover. In this systematic review, we analysed data to insight, through bat-originated spillover in Asia and Africa. We used STATA/IC-13 software for descriptive statistics and meta-analysis. The random effect of meta-analysis showed that the pooled estimates of case fatality rates of bat-originated viral zoonotic diseases were higher in Africa (61.06%, 95%CI: 50.26 to 71.85, l(2) % = 97.3, p < 0.001). Moreover, estimates of case fatality rates were higher in Ebola (61.06%; 95%CI: 50.26 to 71.85, l(2) % = 97.3, p < 0.001) followed by Nipah (55.19%; 95%CI: 39.29 to 71.09, l(2) % = 94.2, p < 0.001), MERS (18.49%; 95%CI: 8.19 to 28.76, l(2) % = 95.4, p < 0.001) and SARS (10.86%; 95%CI: 6.02 to 15.71, l(2) % = 85.7, p < 0.001) with the overall case fatality rates of 29.86 (95%CI: 29.97 to 48.58, l(2) % = 99.0, p < 0.001). Bat-originated viruses have caused several outbreaks of deadly diseases, including Nipah, Ebola, SARS and MERS in Asia and Africa in a sequential fashion. Nipah virus emerged first in Malaysia, but later, periodic outbreaks were noticed in Bangladesh and India. Similarly, the Ebola virus was detected in the African continent with neurological disorders in humans, like Nipah, seen in the Asian region. Two important coronaviruses, MERS and SARS, were introduced, both with the potential to infect respiratory passages.

Recent advances in the understanding of Nipah virus immunopathogenesis and anti-viral approaches.,Pelissier R; Iampietro M; Horvat B,"Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly lethal zoonotic paramyxovirus that emerged at the end of last century as a human pathogen capable of causing severe acute respiratory infection and encephalitis. Although NiV provokes serious diseases in numerous mammalian species, the infection seems to be asymptomatic in NiV natural hosts, the fruit bats, which provide a continuous virus source for further outbreaks. Consecutive human-to-human transmission has been frequently observed during outbreaks in Bangladesh and India. NiV was shown to interfere with the innate immune response and interferon type I signaling, restraining the anti-viral response and permitting viral spread. Studies of adaptive immunity in infected patients and animal models have suggested an unbalanced immune response during NiV infection.

Prioritizing surveillance of Nipah virus in India.,Plowright RK; Becker DJ; Crowley DE; Washburne AD; Huang T; Nameer PO; Gurley ES; Han BA,"The 2018 outbreak of Nipah virus in Kerala, India, highlights the need for global surveillance of henipaviruses in bats, which are the reservoir hosts for this and other viruses. Nipah virus, an emerging paramyxovirus in the genus Henipavirus, causes severe disease and stuttering chains of transmission in humans and is considered a potential pandemic threat. In May 2018, an outbreak of Nipah virus began in Kerala, > 1800 km from the sites of previous outbreaks in eastern India in 2001 and 2007. Twenty-three people were infected and 21 people died (16 deaths and 18 cases were laboratory confirmed). Initial surveillance focused on insectivorous bats (Megaderma spasma), whereas follow-up surveys within Kerala found evidence of Nipah virus in fruit bats (Pteropus medius). P. medius is the confirmed host in Bangladesh and is now a confirmed host in India. However, other bat species may also serve as reservoir hosts of henipaviruses. To inform surveillance of Nipah virus in bats, we reviewed and analyzed the published records of Nipah virus surveillance globally. We applied a trait-based machine learning approach to a subset of species that occur in Asia, Australia, and Oceana. In addition to seven species in Kerala that were previously identified as Nipah virus seropositive, we identified at least four bat species that, on the basis of trait similarity with known Nipah virus-seropositive species, have a relatively high likelihood of exposure to Nipah or Nipah-like viruses in India. These machine-learning approaches provide the first step in the sequence of studies required to assess the risk of Nipah virus spillover in India. Nipah virus surveillance not only within Kerala but also elsewhere in India would benefit from a research pipeline that included surveys of known and predicted reservoirs for serological evidence of past infection with Nipah virus (or cross reacting henipaviruses). Serosurveys should then be followed by longitudinal spatial and temporal studies to detect shedding and isolate virus from species with evidence of infection. Ecological studies will then be required to understand the dynamics governing prevalence and shedding in bats and the contacts that could pose a risk to public health.",2019,Jun,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,13,6,e0007393,,10.1371/journal.pntd.0007393,31246966,#2858,Plowright 2019,"Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Christian Morgenstern (2024-10-27 22:46:15)(Select): prisma flow chart in SI; Tristan Naidoo (2024-10-13 02:47:38)(Screen): Possibly also a review paper?

Neurologic Manifestations of the World Health Organization's List of Pandemic and Epidemic Diseases.,McEntire CRS; Song KW; McInnis RP; Rhee JY; Young M; Williams E; Wibecan LL; Nolan N; Nagy AM; Gluckstein J; Mukerji SS; Mateen FJ,"The World Health Organization (WHO) monitors the spread of diseases globally and maintains a list of diseases with epidemic or pandemic potential. Currently listed diseases include Chikungunya, cholera, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Ebola virus disease, Hendra virus infection, influenza, Lassa fever, Marburg virus disease, Neisseria meningitis, MERS-CoV, monkeypox, Nipah virus infection, novel coronavirus (COVID-19), plague, Rift Valley fever, SARS, smallpox, tularemia, yellow fever, and Zika virus disease. The associated pathogens are increasingly important on the global stage. The majority of these diseases have neurological manifestations. Those with less frequent neurological manifestations may also have important consequences. This is highlighted now in particular through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and reinforces that pathogens with the potential to spread rapidly and widely, in spite of concerted global efforts, may affect the nervous system. We searched the scientific literature, dating from 1934 to August 2020, to compile data on the cause, epidemiology, clinical presentation, neuroimaging features, and treatment of each of the diseases of epidemic or pandemic potential as viewed through a neurologist's lens. We included articles with an abstract or full text in English in this topical and scoping review. Diseases with epidemic and pandemic potential can be spread directly from human to human, animal to human, via mosquitoes or other insects, or via environmental contamination. Manifestations include central neurologic conditions (meningitis, encephalitis, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, seizures), peripheral and cranial nerve syndromes (sensory neuropathy, sensorineural hearing loss, ophthalmoplegia), post-infectious syndromes (acute inflammatory polyneuropathy), and congenital syndromes (fetal microcephaly), among others. Some diseases have not been well-characterized from a neurological standpoint, but all have at least scattered case reports of neurological features. Some of the diseases have curative treatments available while in other cases, supportive care remains the only management option. Regardless of the pathogen, prompt, and aggressive measures to control the spread of these agents are the most important factors in lowering the overall morbidity and mortality they can cause.",2021,,Front Neurol,12,,634827,,10.3389/fneur.2021.634827,33692745,#2860,McEntireCRS 2021,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper
Current progress towards prevention of Nipah and Hendra disease in humans: A scoping review of vaccine and monoclonal antibody candidates being evaluated in clinical trials.,Rodrigue V; Gravagna K; Yao J; Nafade V; Basta NE,"OBJECTIVES: Nipah and Hendra are deadly zoonotic diseases with pandemic potential. To date, no human vaccine or monoclonal antibody (mAb) has been licensed to prevent disease caused by these pathogens. The aim of this scoping review was to identify and describe all Phase I, II, and III clinical trials of vaccine candidates or mAbs candidates designed to prevent Nipah and Hendra in humans and to compare the characteristics of the vaccine candidates to characteristics outlined in the Target Product Profile drafted by the World Health Organisation as part of the WHO Research & Development Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics. METHODS: We searched 23 clinical trial registries, the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials, and grey literature up to June 2023 to identify vaccine and mAb candidates being evaluated in registered clinical trials. Vaccine candidate and trial characteristics were double-extracted for evaluation and the vaccine candidate characteristics were compared with the preferred and critical criteria of the World Health Organisation's Target Product Profile for Nipah virus vaccine. RESULTS: Three vaccine candidates (Hendra Virus Soluble Glycoprotein Vaccine [HeV-sG-V], PHV02, and mRNA-1215) and one mAb (m102.4) had a registered human clinical trial by June 2023. All trials were phase 1, dose-ranging trials taking place in the United States of America or Australia and enrolling healthy adults. Although all vaccine candidates meet the dose regimen and route of administration criteria of the Target Product Profile, other criteria such as measures of efficacy and reactogenicity will need to be evaluated in the future as evidence becomes available. CONCLUSION: Multiple vaccine candidates and one mAb candidate have reached the stage of human clinical trials and are reviewed here. Monitoring progress during evaluation of these candidates and candidates entering clinical trials in the future can help highlight many of the challenges that remain.",2024,May,Trop Med Int Health,29,5,354-364,,10.1111/tmi.13979,38415314,#2868,Rodrigue 2024,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper
Vertical Transfer of Humoral Immunity against Nipah Virus: A Novel Evidence from Bangladesh.,Satter SM; Nazneen A; Aquib WR; Sultana S; Rahman MZ; Klena JD; Montgomery JM; Shirin T,"A major obstacle to in-depth investigation of the immune response against Nipah virus (NiV) infection is its rapid progression and high mortality rate. This paper described novel information on the vertical transfer of immune properties. In January 2020, a female aged below five years and her mother from Faridpur district of Bangladesh were infected. Both had a history of raw date palm sap consumption and were diagnosed as confirmed NiV cases. The daughter passed away, and the mother survived with significant residual neurological impairment. She conceived one and a half year later and was under thorough antenatal follow-up by the surveillance authority. A healthy male baby was born. As part of routine survivor follow-up, specimens were collected from the newborn and tested for NiV infection at the reference laboratory to exclude vertical transmission. Although testing negative for anti-Nipah IgM and PCR for NiV, a high titre of anti-Nipah IgG was observed. The transfer of humoral immunity against NiV from mother to neonate was confirmed for the first time.

Public health threat of novel zoonotic diseases: literature review.,Fiegler-Rudol J; Lau DNMK; Kasperczyk DHNMJ,"Zoonoses, diseases transmitted from animals to humans, continue to challenge public health despite advancements in controlling infectious diseases. The intricate link between human, animal, and environmental health is emphasised by the fact that zoonoses contribute to 60% of emerging human infections. Wet markets, wildlife hunting, intensive wildlife farming, and interactions between domestic animals and humans are key transmission sources. Historical examples like the bubonic plague and English Sweats illustrate the longstanding impact of zoonotic diseases. With new transmission patterns emerging, it is necessary to use new techniques to predict disease spread. This article delves into the emergence of new zoonoses, such as the Nipah virus and the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, emphasizing the importance of understanding zoonotic aspects for outbreak prevention. Re-emerging zoonoses, like tuberculosis and vaccine-preventable diseases, present challenges, exacerbated by factors like globalized human activities and disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

From Protein to Pandemic: The Transdisciplinary Approach Needed to Prevent Spillover and the Next Pandemic.,Plowright RK; Hudson PJ,"Pandemics are a consequence of a series of processes that span scales from viral biology at 10(-9) m to global transmission at 10(6) m. The pathogen passes from one host species to another through a sequence of events that starts with an infected reservoir host and entails interspecific contact, innate immune responses, receptor protein structure within the potential host, and the global spread of the novel pathogen through the naive host population. Each event presents a potential barrier to the onward passage of the virus and should be characterized with an integrated transdisciplinary approach. Epidemic control is based on the prevention of exposure, infection, and disease. However, the ultimate pandemic prevention is prevention of the spillover event itself. Here, we focus on the potential for preventing the spillover of henipaviruses, a group of viruses derived from bats that frequently cross species barriers, incur high human mortality, and are transmitted among humans via stuttering chains. We outline the transdisciplinary approach needed to prevent the spillover process and, therefore, future pandemics.",2021,Jul,Viruses,13,7,,,10.3390/v13071298,34372504,#2887,Plowright 2021,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper
Current status of diagnostic assays for emerging zoonotic viruses: Nipah and Hendra.,Sharma N; Jamwal VL; Nagial S; Ranjan M; Rath D; Gandhi SG,"INTRODUCTION: Nipah and Hendra viruses belong to the Paramyxoviridae family, which pose a significant threat to human health, with sporadic outbreaks causing severe morbidity and mortality. Early symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, and headache, which offer little in terms of differential diagnosis. There are no specific therapeutics and vaccines for these viruses. AREAS COVERED: This review comprehensively covers a spectrum of diagnostic techniques for Nipah and Hendra virus infections, discussed in conjunction with appropriate type of samples during the progression of infection. Serological assays, reverse transcriptase Real-Time PCR assays, and isothermal amplification assays are discussed in detail, along with a listing of few commercially available detection kits. Patents protecting inventions in Nipah and Hendra virus detection are also covered. EXPERT OPINION: Despite several outbreaks of Nipah and Hendra infections in the past decade, in-depth research into their pathogenesis, Point-of-Care diagnostics, specific therapies, and human vaccines is lacking. A prompt and accurate diagnosis is pivotal for efficient outbreak management, patient treatment, and the adoption of preventative measures.

Recent Advances of Nipah Virus Disease: Pathobiology to Treatment and Vaccine Advancement.,Saha S; Bhattacharya M; Lee SS; Chakraborty C,"The zoonotic infection of the Nipah virus (NiV) has yet again appeared in 2023 in Kerala state, India. The virus, which has a mortality rate ranging from about 40 to 70%, has already infected India five times, the first being in 2001. The current infection is the sixth virus outbreak in the Indian population. In 1998, the first NiV infection was noted in one village in Malaysia. After that, outbreaks from other South and Southeast Asian countries have been reported periodically. It can spread between humans through contact with body fluids. Therefore, it is unlikely to generate a new pandemic. However, there is a considerable knowledge gap in the different areas of NiV. To date, no approved vaccines or treatments have been available. To fulfil the knowledge gap, the review article provided a detailed overview of the genome and genome-encoded proteins, epidemiology, transmission, pathobiology, immunobiology, diagnosis, prevention and control measures, therapeutics (monoclonal antibodies and drug molecules), and vaccine advancement of the emerging and deadly pathogen.

"Hendra virus: Epidemiology dynamics in relation to climate change, diagnostic tests and control measures.",Yuen KY; Fraser NS; Henning J; Halpin K; Gibson JS; Betzien L; Stewart AJ,"Hendra virus (HeV) continues to pose a serious public health concern as spillover events occur sporadically. Terminally ill horses can exhibit a range of clinical signs including frothy nasal discharge, ataxia or forebrain signs. Early signs, if detected, can include depression, inappetence, colic or mild respiratory signs. All unvaccinated ill horses in areas where flying foxes exist, may potentially be infected with HeV, posing a significant risk to the veterinary community. Equivac® HeV vaccine has been fully registered in Australia since 2015 (and under an Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority special permit since 2012) for immunization of horses against HeV and is the most effective and direct solution to prevent disease transmission to horses and protect humans. No HeV vaccinated horse has tested positive for HeV infection. There is no registered vaccine to prevent, or therapeutics to treat, HeV infection in humans. Previous equine HeV outbreaks tended to cluster in winter overlapping with the foaling season (August to December), when veterinarians and horse owners have frequent close contact with horses and their bodily fluids, increasing the chance of zoonotic disease transmission. The most southerly case was detected in 2019 in the Upper Hunter region in New South Wales, which is Australia's Thoroughbred horse breeding capital. Future spillover events are predicted to move further south and inland in Queensland and New South Wales, aligning with the moving distribution of the main reservoir hosts. Here we (1) review HeV epidemiology and climate change predicted infection dynamics, (2) present a biosecurity protocol for veterinary clinics and hospitals to adopt, and (3) describe diagnostic tests currently available and those under development.

Nipah virus dynamics in bats and implications for spillover to humans.,Epstein JH; Anthony SJ; Islam A; Kilpatrick AM; Ali Khan S; Balkey MD; Ross N; Smith I; Zambrana-Torrelio C; Tao Y; Quan PL; Olival KJ; Khan MSU; Gurley ES; Hossein MJ; Field HE; Fielder MD; Briese T; Rahman M; Broder CC; Crameri G; Wang LF; Luby SP; Lipkin WI; Daszak P,"Nipah virus (NiV) is an emerging bat-borne zoonotic virus that causes near-annual outbreaks of fatal encephalitis in South Asia-one of the most populous regions on Earth. In Bangladesh, infection occurs when people drink date-palm sap contaminated with bat excreta. Outbreaks are sporadic, and the influence of viral dynamics in bats on their temporal and spatial distribution is poorly understood. We analyzed data on host ecology, molecular epidemiology, serological dynamics, and viral genetics to characterize spatiotemporal patterns of NiV dynamics in its wildlife reservoir, Pteropus medius bats, in Bangladesh. We found that NiV transmission occurred throughout the country and throughout the year. Model results indicated that local transmission dynamics were modulated by density-dependent transmission, acquired immunity that is lost over time, and recrudescence. Increased transmission followed multiyear periods of declining seroprevalence due to bat-population turnover and individual loss of humoral immunity. Individual bats had smaller host ranges than other Pteropus species (spp.), although movement data and the discovery of a Malaysia-clade NiV strain in eastern Bangladesh suggest connectivity with bats east of Bangladesh. These data suggest that discrete multiannual local epizootics in bat populations contribute to the sporadic nature of NiV outbreaks in South Asia.

A Review on Emerging Infectious Diseases Prioritized Under the 2018 WHO Research and Development Blueprint: Lessons from the Indian Context.,Kojom LP; Singh V,"Objective: This review describes the current scenario of a priority group of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) listed by World Health Organization (WHO), and their main determinants and drivers for the emergence/spread of the diseases. The gaps and strategies developed by India to meet the WHO guidelines on the effective control of epidemic-prone diseases and outbreaks are also presented in the review. Methods: Epidemiologic information of EIDs, namely Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Ebola and Marburg viruses (EboV and MarV), Zika virus (ZIKAV), Rift Valley fever (RVF), Middle East respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Nipah and Hendra virus (NiV and HeV), and Lassa fever virus (LASV), was drawn from international and national electronic databases to assess the situation. A brief view on the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in India is also included. Results: There are no reports for human infection of EboV, MarV, RVF, and LASV in India. CCHF, SARS, ZIKAV, and NiV have been involved in outbreaks in eight states of India, while COVID-19 is currently reported from majority of states. India has deeply strengthened its surveillance and response system of outbreaks and epidemic-prone diseases.

Nipah virus - the rising epidemic: a review.,Ochani RK; Batra S; Shaikh A; Asad A,"The Nipah virus was discovered twenty years ago, and there is considerable information available regarding the specificities surrounding this virus such as transmission, pathogenesis and genome. Belonging to the Henipavirus genus, this virus can cause fever, encephalitis and respiratory disorders. The first cases were reported in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998, when affected individuals presented with severe febrile encephalitis. Since then, much has been identified about this virus. These single-stranded RNA viruses gain entry into target cells via a process known as macropinocytosis. The viral genome is released into the cell cytoplasm via a cascade of processes that involves conformational changes in G and F proteins which allow for attachment of the viral membrane to the cell membrane. In addition to this, the natural reservoirs of this virus have been identified to be fruit bats from the genus Pteropus. Five of the 14 species of bats in Malaysia have been identified as carriers, and this virus affects horses, cats, dogs, pigs and humans. Various mechanisms of transmission have been proposed such as contamination of date palm saps by bat feces and saliva, nosocomial and human-to-human transmissions. Physical contact was identified as the strongest risk factor for developing an infection in the 2004 Faridpur outbreak. Geographically, the virus seems to favor the Indian sub-continent, Indonesia, Southeast Asia, Pakistan, southern China, northern Australia and the Philippines, as demonstrated by the multiple outbreaks in 2001, 2004, 2007, 2012 in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan as well as the initial outbreaks in Malaysia and Singapore. Multiple routes of the viremic spread in the human body have been identified such as the central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory system, while virus levels in the body remain low, detection in the cerebrospinal fluid is comparatively high. The virus follows an incubation period of 4 days to 2 weeks which is followed by the development of symptoms. The primary clinical signs include fever, headache, vomiting and dizziness, while the characteristic symptoms consist of segmental myoclonus, tachycardia, areflexia, hypotonia, abnormal pupillary reflexes and hypertension. The serum neutralization test (SNT) is the gold standard of diagnosis followed by ELISA if SNT cannot be carried out. On the other hand, treatment is supportive since there a lack of effective pharmacological therapy and only one equine vaccine is currently licensed for use. Prevention of outbreaks seems to be a more viable approach until specific therapeutic strategies are devised.",2019,Jun,Infez Med,27,2,117-127,,,31205033,#2902,Ochani 2019,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper
"Risk of Viral Infectious Diseases from Live Bats, Primates, Rodents and Carnivores for Sale in Indonesian Wildlife Markets.",Morcatty TQ; Pereyra PER; Ardiansyah A; Imron MA; Hedger K; Campera M; Nekaris KA; Nijman V,"Southeast Asia is considered a global hotspot of emerging zoonotic diseases. There, wildlife is commonly traded under poor sanitary conditions in open markets; these markets have been considered 'the perfect storm' for zoonotic disease transmission. We assessed the potential of wildlife trade in spreading viral diseases by quantifying the number of wild animals of four mammalian orders (Rodentia, Chiroptera, Carnivora and Primates) on sale in 14 Indonesian wildlife markets and identifying zoonotic viruses potentially hosted by these animals. We constructed a network analysis to visualize the animals that are traded alongside each other that may carry similar viruses. We recorded 6725 wild animals of at least 15 species on sale. Cities and markets with larger human population and number of stalls, respectively, offered more individuals for sale. Eight out of 15 animal taxa recorded are hosts of 17 zoonotic virus species, nine of which can infect more than one species as a host. The network analysis showed that long-tailed macaque has the greatest potential for spreading viral diseases, since it is simultaneously the most traded species, sold in 13/14 markets, and a potential host for nine viruses. It is traded alongside pig-tailed macaques in three markets, with which it shares six viruses in common (Cowpox, Dengue, Hepatitis E, Herpes B, Simian foamy, and Simian retrovirus type D).

Recent Advances in Immunological Landscape and Immunotherapeutic Agent of Nipah Virus Infection.,Chakraborty C; Saha S; Bhattacharya M,"Over the last two decades, the Nipah virus (NiV) emerged as a highly lethal zoonotic pathogen to humans. Outbreaks occurred occasionally in South and Southeast Asia. Therefore, a safe and effective vaccine against the virus is needed to fight against the deadly virus. Understanding the immunological landscape during this lethal virus infection is necessary in this direction. However, we found scattered information on the immunological landscape of the virus's reservoir, as well as hosts such as humans and livestock. The review provides a recent understanding of the immunological landscape of the virus's reservoir, human hosts, monoclonal antibodies, and vaccines for NiV infection. To describe the immunological landscape, we divided our review article into some points. Firstly, we illustrated bats' immune response as a reservoir during the NiV infection. Secondly, we illustrated an overview of the molecular mechanisms underlying the immune response to the NiV infection, various immune cells, humans' innate immune response, adaptive immunity, and the landscape of cytokines and chemokines. We also discussed INF escape, NET evasion, the T cell landscape, and the B cell landscape during virus infection. Thirdly, we also demonstrated the potential monoclonal antibody therapeutics, and vaccines. Finally, neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) of NiV and potentially other therapeutic strategies were discussed.

A review of mechanistic models of viral dynamics in bat reservoirs for zoonotic disease.,Gentles AD; Guth S; Rozins C; Brook CE,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus with suspected bat origins, highlights a critical need for heightened understanding of the mechanisms by which bats maintain potentially zoonotic viruses at the population level and transmit these pathogens across species. We review mechanistic models, which test hypotheses of the transmission dynamics that underpin viral maintenance in bat systems. A search of the literature identified only twenty-five mechanistic models of bat-virus systems published to date, derived from twenty-three original studies. Most models focused on rabies and related lyssaviruses (eleven), followed by Ebola-like filoviruses (seven), Hendra and Nipah-like henipaviruses (five), and coronaviruses (two). The vast majority of studies has modelled bat virus transmission dynamics at the population level, though a few nested within-host models of viral pathogenesis in population-level frameworks, and one study focused on purely within-host dynamics. Population-level studies described bat virus systems from every continent but Antarctica, though most were concentrated in North America and Africa; indeed, only one simulation model with no associated data was derived from an Asian bat-virus system. In fact, of the twenty-five models identified, only ten population-level models were fitted to data - emphasizing an overall dearth of empirically derived epidemiological inference in bat virus systems. Within the data fitted subset, the vast majority of models were fitted to serological data only, highlighting extensive uncertainty in our understanding of the transmission status of a wild bat.

The recent Nipah virus outbreak in Bangladesh could be a threat for global public health: A brief report.,Nazmunnahar; Ahmed I; Roknuzzaman ASM; Islam MR,"The Nipah virus is a zoonotic infection that can potentially be transmitted from person to person as well as through ingesting contaminated food. It has a high fatality rate, and no treatment or cure at present. Several nations in South Asia have reported Nipah virus outbreaks occurred during a particular season of the year. Since it was first found in Bangladesh in 2001, there have been a total of 335 people infected with it, and 237 of those people have passed away as a result of their infection. With increased public awareness, community engagement, and preventative measures, this potentially fatal virus has been suppressed. Yet, following a pandemic and a considerable increase in the health burden, the transmission rate continuously increased over a few years, indicating that there is a growing possibility to become a global public health concern. Without effective vaccines and reliable treatment options, its capacity for human-to-human transmission and potential to spread throughout the area could result in a disastrous public health emergency worldwide.",2023,Jul,Health Sci Rep,6,7,e1423,,10.1002/hsr2.1423,37448729,#2936,Nazmunnahar 2023,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Tristan Naidoo (2024-10-13 02:54:41)(Screen): Perspective piece; ,""
Response of the health system in Nipah outbreak in Ernakulam district: A qualitative analysis.,Menon VB; George LS,"BACKGROUND: Nipah is an emerging zoonotic disease that is transmitted through contaminated food or directly between people. Recently, Nipah virus infection was confirmed in Kochi, Kerala, making it the fourth outbreak reported in India. However, due to its good epidemic response, the health system of Kerala was able to control it in a timely manner. OBJECTIVE: To qualitatively analyse the response of the health system of Kerala in controlling the Nipah outbreak (2019) by identifying the enabling factors and the challenges faced by it. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted using grounded theory approach. Key informant interviews were conducted till data saturation was reached. The audio recorded data was translated, transcribed and was manually coded and thematically analysed. RESULTS: The major enablers for its apt response were identified to be effective communication, good line of control, effective division of work, intersectorial coordination, strong leadership, political commitment, resilient public private partnership and support groups, past experiences in disaster management, quick procurement of medicines and availability of lab facilities. On the other hand, the challenges identified were initial confusions, lack of standard operating procedures/guidelines for epidemic management, complacency, lack of effective zoonotic surveillance, media management and community participation. CONCLUSION: This study attributes the success of the outbreak response to the strong leadership and political commitment. In order to prevent recurrences in the future, there is a need to build a resilient health system through capacity building and further strengthening of the surveillance system.",2021,Sep,J Family Med Prim Care,10,9,3355-3360,,10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_801_21,34760757,#2945,Menon 2021,Exclusion reason: No report of parameters (including seroprevalance and other measures of interest) or transmission or historical outbreaks; ,""
Disentangling serology to elucidate henipa- and filovirus transmission in Madagascar fruit bats.,Brook CE; Ranaivoson HC; Broder CC; Cunningham AA; Héraud JM; Peel AJ; Gibson L; Wood JLN; Metcalf CJ; Dobson AP,"Bats are reservoirs for emerging human pathogens, including Hendra and Nipah henipaviruses and Ebola and Marburg filoviruses. These viruses demonstrate predictable patterns in seasonality and age structure across multiple systems; previous work suggests that they may circulate in Madagascar's endemic fruit bats, which are widely consumed as human food. We aimed to (a) document the extent of henipa- and filovirus exposure among Malagasy fruit bats, (b) explore seasonality in seroprevalence and serostatus in these bat populations and (c) compare mechanistic hypotheses for possible transmission dynamics underlying these data. To this end, we amassed and analysed a unique dataset documenting longitudinal serological henipa- and filovirus dynamics in three Madagascar fruit bat species. We uncovered serological evidence of exposure to Hendra-/Nipah-related henipaviruses in Eidolon dupreanum, Pteropus rufus and Rousettus madagascariensis, to Cedar-related henipaviruses in E. dupreanum and R. madagascariensis and to Ebola-related filoviruses in P. rufus and R. madagascariensis. We demonstrated significant seasonality in population-level seroprevalence and individual serostatus for multiple viruses across these species, linked to the female reproductive calendar. An age-structured subset of the data highlighted evidence of waning maternal antibodies in neonates, increasing seroprevalence in young and decreasing seroprevalence late in life. Comparison of mechanistic epidemiological models fit to these data offered support for transmission hypotheses permitting waning antibodies but retained immunity in adult-age bats. Our findings suggest that bats may seasonally modulate mechanisms of pathogen control, with consequences for population-level transmission. Additionally, we narrow the field of candidate transmission hypotheses by which bats are presumed to host and transmit potentially zoonotic viruses globally.",2019,Jul,J Anim Ecol,88,7,1001-1016,Dryad/10.5061/dryad.61tc3hd,10.1111/1365-2656.12985,30908623,#2946,Brook 2019,Exclusion reason: No report of parameters (including seroprevalance and other measures of interest) or transmission or historical outbreaks; ,""
Assessing the feasibility of Nipah vaccine efficacy trials based on previous outbreaks in Bangladesh.,Nikolay B; Ribeiro Dos Santos G; Lipsitch M; Rahman M; Luby SP; Salje H; Gurley ES; Cauchemez S,"BACKGROUND: Nipah virus (NiV) is an emerging, bat-borne pathogen that can be transmitted from person-to-person. Vaccines are currently being developed for NiV, and studies have been funded to evaluate their safety and immunogenicity. An important unanswered question is whether it will be possible to evaluate the efficacy of vaccine candidates in phase III clinical trials in a context where spillovers from the zoonotic reservoir are infrequent and associated with small outbreaks. The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of conducting a phase III vaccine trial in Bangladesh, the only country regularly reporting NiV cases. METHODS: We used simulations based on previously observed NiV cases from Bangladesh, an assumed vaccine efficacy of 90% and other NiV vaccine target characteristics, to compare three vaccination study designs: (i) cluster randomized ring vaccination, (ii) cluster randomized mass vaccination, and (iii) an observational case-control study design. RESULTS: The simulations showed that, assuming a ramp-up period of 10 days and a mean hospitalization delay of 4 days,a cluster-randomized ring vaccination trial would require 516 years and over 163,000 vaccine doses to run a ring vaccination trial under current epidemic conditions. A cluster-randomized mass vaccination trial in the two most affected districts would take 43 years and 1.83 million vaccine doses. An observational case-control design in these two districts would require seven years and 2.5 million vaccine doses. DISCUSSION: Without a change in the epidemiology of NiV, ring vaccination or mass vaccination trials are unlikely to be completed within a reasonable time window. In this light, the remaining options are: (i) not conducting a phase III trial until the epidemiology of NiV changes, (ii) identifying alternative ways to licensure such as observational studies or controlled studies in animals such as in the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Animal Rule.",2021,Sep,Vaccine,39,39,5600-5606,,10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.027,34426025,#2947,Nikolay 2021,Exclusion reason: No report of parameters (including seroprevalance and other measures of interest) or transmission or historical outbreaks; ,""

METHODOLOGY: In a PubMed systematic search, 929 citations were found. After screening and eligibility, 22 studies were included. This study obtained age, gender, geographic regions, diagnostic methods, data collection methods, and bias risk. The case fatality rate (CFR) and NiV infection risk variables were evaluated by meta-analysis. RESULTS: Southeast Asia, especially Bangladesh and Malaysia, had the most NiV cases. The major diagnostic method was blood and cerebrospinal fluid IgM and IgG antibody tests, and males predominated. Proxy respondents and matched controls were utilized for risk factor analyses when patients could not answer. The pooled CFR for NiV encephalitis was 61.0%, indicating severity. Risk factors included pigs, nighttime bats near homes, tree climbing, and male gender. CONCLUSION: Southeast Asian public health is plagued by NiV encephalitis.

Scoping future outbreaks: a scoping review on the outbreak prediction of the WHO Blueprint list of priority diseases.,Jonkmans N; D'Acremont V; Flahault A,"BACKGROUND: The WHO's Research and Development Blueprint priority list designates emerging diseases with the potential to generate public health emergencies for which insufficient preventive solutions exist. The list aims to reduce the time to the availability of resources that can avert public health crises. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic illustrates that an effective method of mitigating such crises is the pre-emptive prediction of outbreaks. This scoping review thus aimed to map and identify the evidence available to predict future outbreaks of the Blueprint diseases. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of PubMed, Embase and Web of Science related to the evidence predicting future outbreaks of Ebola and Marburg virus, Zika virus, Lassa fever, Nipah and Henipaviral disease, Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome and Disease X. Prediction methods, outbreak features predicted and implementation of predictions were evaluated. We conducted a narrative and quantitative evidence synthesis to highlight prediction methods that could be further investigated for the prevention of Blueprint diseases and COVID-19 outbreaks. RESULTS: Out of 3959 articles identified, we included 58 articles based on inclusion criteria. 5 major prediction methods emerged; the most frequent being spatio-temporal risk maps predicting outbreak risk periods and locations through vector and climate data. Stochastic models were predominant. Rift Valley fever was the most predicted disease. Diseases with complex sociocultural factors such as Ebola were often predicted through multifactorial risk-based estimations. 10% of models were implemented by health authorities. No article predicted Disease X outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: Spatiotemporal models for diseases with strong climatic and vectorial components, as in River Valley fever prediction, may currently best reduce the time to the availability of resources. A wide literature gap exists in the prediction of zoonoses with complex sociocultural and ecological dynamics such as Ebola, COVID-19 and especially Disease X.",2021,Sep,BMJ Glob Health,6,9,,,10.1136/bmjgh-2021-006623,34531189,#2951,Jonkmans 2021,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper
"Are we ready to fight the Nipah virus pandemic? An overview of drug targets, current medications, and potential leads.",Yang S; Kar S,"Nipah virus (NiV) is a high-lethality RNA virus from the family of Paramyxoviridae and genus Henipavirus, classified under Biosafety Level-4 (BSL-4) pathogen due to the severity of pathogenicity and lack of medications and vaccines. Direct contacts or the body fluids of infected animals are the major factor of transmission of NiV. As it is not an airborne infection, the transmission rate is relatively low. Still, mutations of the NiV in the animal reservoir over the years, followed by zoonotic transfer, can make the deadliness of the virus manifold in upcoming years. Therefore, there is no denial of the possibility of a pandemic after COVID-19 considering the severe pathogenicity of NiV, and that is why we need to be prepared with possible drugs in upcoming days. Considering the time constraints, computational aided drug design (CADD) is an efficient way to study the virus and perform the drug design and test the HITs to lead experimentally. Therefore, this review focuses primarily on NiV target proteins (covering NiV and human), experimentally tested repurposed drug details, and latest computational studies on potential lead molecules, which can be explored as potential drug candidates. Computationally identified drug candidates, including their chemical structures, docking scores, amino acid level interaction with corresponding protein, and the platform used for the studies, are thoroughly discussed. The review will offer a one-stop study to access what had been performed and what can be performed in the CADD of NiV.",2023,Mar,Struct Chem,,,1-19,,10.1007/s11224-023-02148-6,37363045,#2958,Yang 2023,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper

A 'what-if' scenario: Nipah virus attacks pig trade chains in Thailand.,Wongnak P; Thanapongtharm W; Kusakunniran W; Karnjanapreechakorn S; Sutassananon K; Kalpravidh W; Wongsathapornchai K; Wiratsudakul A,"BACKGROUND: Nipah virus (NiV) is a fatal zoonotic agent that was first identified amongst pig farmers in Malaysia in 1998, in an outbreak that resulted in 105 fatal human cases. That epidemic arose from a chain of infection, initiating from bats to pigs, and which then spilled over from pigs to humans. In Thailand, bat-pig-human communities can be observed across the country, particularly in the central plain. The present study therefore aimed to identify high-risk areas for potential NiV outbreaks and to model how the virus is likely to spread. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and weighted linear combination (WLC) were employed to produce the NiV risk map. The map was then overlaid with the nationwide pig movement network to identify the index subdistricts in which NiV may emerge. Subsequently, susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) modeling was used to simulate NiV spread within each subdistrict, and network modeling was used to illustrate how the virus disperses across subdistricts. RESULTS: Based on the MCDA and pig movement data, 14 index subdistricts with a high-risk of NiV emergence were identified. We found in our infectious network modeling that the infected subdistricts clustered in, or close to the central plain, within a range of 171 km from the source subdistricts. However, the virus may travel as far as 528.5 km (R(0) = 5). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the risk of NiV dissemination through pig movement networks in Thailand is low but not negligible. The risk areas identified in our study can help the veterinary authority to allocate financial and human resources to where preventive strategies, such as pig farm regionalization, are required and to contain outbreaks in a timely fashion once they occur.",2020,Aug,BMC Vet Res,16,1,300,,10.1186/s12917-020-02502-4,32838786,#2969,Wongnak 2020,Exclusion reason: Wrong pathogen or pathogen epidemiology or transmission not main focus; ,Animal model
Emerging zoonotic diseases in Southeast Asia in the period 2011-2022: a systematic literature review.,Nguyen TT; Mai TN; Dang-Xuan S; Nguyen-Viet H; Unger F; Lee HS,"As COVID-19 has shown, pandemics and outbreaks of emerging infections such as Zika, Nipah, monkeypox and antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, especially emerging zoonotic diseases, continue to occur and may even be increasing in Southeast Asia.

Detailed Molecular Biochemistry for Novel Therapeutic Design Against Nipah and Hendra Virus: A Systematic Review.,Bhattacharya S; Dhar S; Banerjee A; Ray S,"BACKGROUND: Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) of genus Henipavirus are the deadliest zoonotic viruses, which cause severe respiratory ailments and fatal encephalitis in humans and other susceptible animals. The fatality rate for these infections had been alarmingly high with no approved treatment available to date. Viral attachment and fusion with host cell membrane is essential for viral entry and is the most essential event of viral infection. Viral attachment is mediated by interaction of Henipavirus attachment glycoprotein (G) with the host cell receptor: Ephrin B2/B3, while viral fusion and endocytosis are mediated by the combined action of both viral glycoprotein (G) and fusion protein (F). CONCLUSION: This review highlights the mechanism of viral attachment, fusion and also explains the basic mechanism and pathobiology of this infection in humans. The drugs and therapeutics used either experimentally or clinically against NiV and HeV infection have been documented and classified in detail.

Neuronal infection is a major pathogenetic mechanism and cause of fatalities in human acute Nipah virus encephalitis.,Ong KC; Ng KY; Ng CW; Tan SH; Teo WL; Karim N; Kumar S; Wong KT,"OBJECTIVES: Acute Nipah (NiV) encephalitis is characterised by a dual pathogenetic mechanism of neuroglial infection and ischaemia-microinfarction associated with vasculitis-induced thrombotic occlusion. We investigated the contributions of these two mechanisms in fatal cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed brain tissues (cerebrum, brainstem and cerebellum) from 15 autopsies using light microscopy, immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridisation and quantitative methods. RESULTS: Three types of discrete plaque-like parenchymal lesions were identified: Type 1 with neuroglial IHC positivity for viral antigens and minimal or no necrosis; Type 2 with neuroglial immunopositivity and necrosis; and Type 3 with necrosis but no viral antigens. Most viral antigen/RNA-positive cells were neurons. Cerebral glial immunopositivity was rare, suggesting that microinfarction played a more important role in white matter injury. Type 1 lesions were also detected in the brainstem and cerebellum, but the differences between cerebral cortex and these two regions were not statistically significant. In the cerebral cortex, Type 1 lesions overwhelmingly predominated, and only 14% Type 1 vs 69% Type 2 lesions were associated with thrombosis. This suggests that neuronal infection as a mechanism of pathogenesis was more important than microinfarction, both in general and in Type 1 lesions in particular. Between the 'early' group (<8-day fever) and the 'late' group (≥8-day fever), there was a decrease of Type 1 and Type 2 lesions with a concomitant increase of Type 3 lesions, suggesting the latter possibly represented late-stage microinfarction and/or neuronal infection.

"Non-malarial febrile illness: a systematic review of published aetiological studies and case reports from Southern Asia and South-eastern Asia, 1980-2015.",Shrestha P; Dahal P; Ogbonnaa-Njoku C; Das D; Stepniewska K; Thomas NV; Hopkins H; Crump JA; Bell D; Newton PN; Ashley EA; Guérin PJ,"BACKGROUND: In the absence of definitive diagnosis, healthcare providers are likely to prescribe empirical antibacterials to those who test negative for malaria. This problem is of critical importance in Southern Asia (SA) and South-eastern Asia (SEA) where high levels of antimicrobial consumption and high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance have been reported. To improve management and guide further diagnostic test development, better understanding is needed of the true causative agents of fever and their geographical variability. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of published literature (1980-2015) to characterise the spectrum of pathogens causing non-malarial febrile illness in SA and SEA. We searched six databases in English and French languages: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health (CABI) database, WHO Global Health Library, PASCAL, and Bulletin de la Société Française de Parasitologie (BDSP). Selection criteria included reporting on an infection or infections with a confirmed diagnosis, defined as pathogens detected in or cultured from samples from normally sterile sites, or serological evidence of current or past infection. RESULTS: A total of 29,558 records from 19 countries in SA and SEA were screened, of which 2410 (8.1%) met the selection criteria. Bacterial aetiologies were reported in 1235 (51.2%) articles, viral in 846 (35.1%), parasitic in 132 (5.5%), and fungal in 54 (2.2%), and 143 (6.0%) articles reported more than one pathogen group. In descending order of frequency, Salmonella Typhi, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and coagulase negative Staphylococcus were the commonly reported bacteria, while dengue virus, chikungunya virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus were common viral pathogens reported. Reports of rarely reported or emerging pathogens included a case report of Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease) in India in 2010 and reports of Nipah virus in Singapore and India. CONCLUSIONS: This review summarises the reported non-malaria pathogens that may cause febrile illness in SA and SEA.

Outbreak prone communicable diseases of public health importance in the northern districts of West Bengal - Current status & the way forward.,Sharma PK; Tilak R,"India is perilously poised on the threshold of an explosion of infectious diseases, some of which have witnessed re-emergence while others await apposite opportunity to do so. The State of West Bengal is uniquely positioned with its innate geographical vulnerabilities that favour outbreaks of a host of infectious diseases. The northern districts of this State are well known endemic areas for many outbreak prone communicable diseases like malaria, Japanese encephalitis, scrub typhus, dengue and kala-azar. An outbreak of Nipah virus in the recent past is a pointer towards the emerging and re-emerging threat in these regions and warrants urgent prioritization for surveillance and monitoring of these diseases. Identification of risk factors, challenges in delivery of primary healthcare, implementation of intervention strategies along with strengthening of healthcare setup are also the need of the hour.

Nipah virus: a potential pandemic agent in the context of the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic.,Devnath P; Masud HMAA,"For centuries, zoonotic diseases have been responsible for various outbreaks resulting in the deaths of millions of people. The best example of this is the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Nipah virus is another deadly virus which has caused several outbreaks in the last few years. Though it causes a low number of infections, disease severity results in a higher death rate.

"Updated Insights into the Phylogenetics, Phylodynamics, and Genetic Diversity of Nipah Virus (NiV).",de Campos GM; Cella E; Kashima S; Alcântara LCJ; Sampaio SC; Elias MC; Giovanetti M; Slavov SN,"Nipah virus (NiV), a biosafety level 4 agent, was first identified in human clinical cases during an outbreak in 1998 in Malaysia and Singapore. While flying foxes are the primary host and viral vector, the infection is associated with a severe clinical presentation in humans, resulting in a high mortality rate. Therefore, NiV is considered a virus with an elevated epidemic potential which is further underscored by its recent emergence (September 2023) as an outbreak in India. Given the situation, it is paramount to understand the molecular dynamics of the virus to shed more light on its evolution and prevent potential future outbreaks. In this study, we conducted Bayesian phylogenetic analysis on all available NiV complete genomes, including partial N-gene NiV sequences (≥1000 bp) in public databases since the first human case, registered in 1998. We observed the distribution of genomes into three main clades corresponding to the genotypes Malaysia, Bangladesh and India, with the Malaysian clade being the oldest in evolutionary terms. The Bayesian skyline plot showed a recent increase in the viral population size since 2019. Protein analysis showed the presence of specific protein families (Hendra_C) in bats that might keep the infection in an asymptomatic state in bats, which also serve as viral vectors. Our results further indicate a shortage of complete NiV genomes, which would be instrumental in gaining a better understanding of NiV's molecular evolution and preventing future outbreaks. Our investigation also underscores the critical need to strengthen genomic surveillance based on complete NiV genomes that will aid thorough genetic characterization of the circulating NiV strains and the phylogenetic relationships between the henipaviruses. This approach will better prepare us to tackle the challenges posed by the NiV virus and other emerging viruses.",2024,Jan,Viruses,16,2,,,10.3390/v16020171,38399947,#3060,deCampos 2024,Exclusion reason: No report of parameters (including seroprevalance and other measures of interest) or transmission or historical outbreaks; ,""
A systematic review on Nipah virus: global molecular epidemiology and medical countermeasures development.,Tan FH; Sukri A; Idris N; Ong KC; Schee JP; Tan CT; Tan SH; Wong KT; Wong LP; Tee KK; Chang LY,"Nipah virus (NiV) is an emerging pathogen that causes encephalitis and a high mortality rate in infected subjects. This systematic review aimed to comprehensively analyze the global epidemiology and research advancements of NiV to identify the key knowledge gaps in the literature. Articles searched using literature databases, namely PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct yielded 5,596 articles. After article screening, 97 articles were included in this systematic review, comprising 41 epidemiological studies and 56 research developments on NiV. The majority of the NiV epidemiological studies were conducted in Bangladesh, reflecting the country's significant burden of NiV outbreaks. The initial NiV outbreak was identified in Malaysia in 1998, with subsequent outbreaks reported in Bangladesh, India, and the Philippines. Transmission routes vary by country, primarily through pigs in Malaysia, consumption of date palm juice in Bangladesh, and human-to-human in India. However, the availability of NiV genome sequences remains limited, particularly from Malaysia and India. Mortality rates also vary according to the country, exceeding 70% in Bangladesh, India, and the Philippines, and less than 40% in Malaysia. Understanding these differences in mortality rate among countries is crucial for informing NiV epidemiology and enhancing outbreak prevention and management strategies. In terms of research developments, the majority of studies focused on vaccine development, followed by phylogenetic analysis and antiviral research. While many vaccines and antivirals have demonstrated complete protection in animal models, only two vaccines have progressed to clinical trials. Phylogenetic analyses have revealed distinct clades between NiV Malaysia, NiV Bangladesh, and NiV India, with proposals to classify NiV India as a separate strain from NiV Bangladesh. Taken together, comprehensive OneHealth approaches integrating disease surveillance and research are imperative for future NiV studies. Expanding the dataset of NiV genome sequences, particularly from Malaysia, Bangladesh, and India will be pivotal.

The aim of this study was to investigate the etiology of CNS infections in a rural area of Nepal using molecular methods. From November 2014 to February 2016, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected from 176 consecutive patients presenting at United Mission Hospital in Tansen, Nepal, with symptoms of possible CNS infection. After the CSF samples were stored and transported frozen, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in Sweden, targeting a total of 26 pathogens using the FilmArray(®) ME panel (BioFire, bioMerieux, Salt Lake City, UT), the MeningoFinder(®) 2SMART (PathoFinder, Maastricht, The Netherlands), and an in-house PCR test for dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and Nipah virus (NiV). The etiology could be determined in 23%. The bacteria detected were Haemophilus influenzae (n = 5), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 4), and Neisseria meningitidis (n = 1). The most common virus was enterovirus detected in eight samples, all during the monsoon season. Other viruses detected were cytomegalovirus (n = 6), varicella zoster virus (n = 5), Epstein-Barr virus (n = 3), herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 (HSV-1) (n = 3), HSV-2 (n = 3), human herpes virus (HHV) type 6 (HHV-6) (n = 3), and HHV-7 (n = 2). Cryptococcus neoformans/gatti was found in four samples. None of the samples were positive for DENV, JEV, or NiV. Of the patients, 67% had been exposed to antibiotics before lumbar puncture.

Divergent Viruses Discovered in Swine Alter the Understanding of Evolutionary History and Genetic Diversity of the Respirovirus Genus and Related Porcine Parainfluenza Viruses.,Zhao J; Sun J; Li X; Xing G; Zhang Y; Lai A; Baele G; Ji X; Su S,"Paramyxoviridae is a rapidly growing family of viruses, whose potential for cross-species transmission makes it difficult to predict the harm of newly emerging viruses to humans and animals. To better understand their diversity, evolutionary history, and co-evolution with their hosts, we analyzed a collection of porcine parainfluenza virus (PPIV) genomes to reconstruct the species classification basis and evolutionary history of the Respirovirus genus. We sequenced 17 complete genomes of porcine respirovirus 1 (also known as porcine parainfluenza virus 1; PPIV-1), thereby nearly tripling the number of currently available PPIV-1 genomes. We found that PPIV-1 was widely prevalent in China with two divergent lineages, PPIV-1a and PPIV-1b. We further provided evidence that a new species, porcine parainfluenza virus 2 (PPIV-2), had recently emerged in China. Our results pointed to a need for revising the current species demarcation criteria of the Respirovirus genus. In addition, we used PPIV-1 as an example to explore recombination and diversity of the Respirovirus genus. Interestingly, we only detected heterosubtypic recombination events between PPIV-1a and PPIV-1b with no intrasubtypic recombination events. The recombination hotspots highlighted a diverse geography-dependent genome structure of paramyxovirus infecting swine in China. Furthermore, we found no evidence of co-evolution between respirovirus and its host, indicating frequent cross-species transmission. In summary, our analyses showed that swine can be infected with a broad range of respiroviruses and recombination may serve as an important evolutionary mechanism for the Respirovirus genus' greater diversity in genome structure than previously anticipated. IMPORTANCE Livestock have emerged as critically underrecognized sources of paramyxovirus diversity, including pigs serving as the source of Nipah virus (NiV) and swine parainfluenza virus type 3, and goats and bovines harboring highly divergent viral lineages. Here, we identified a new species of Respirovirus genus named PPIV-2 in swine and proposed to revise the species demarcation criteria of the Respirovirus genus. We found heterosubtypic recombination events and high genetic diversity in PPIV-1. Further, we showed that genetic recombination may have occurred in the Respirovirus genus which may be associated with host range expansion. The continued expansion of Respirovirus genus diversity in livestock with relatively high human contact rates requires enhanced surveillance and ongoing evaluation of emerging cross-species transmission threats.",2022,Jun,Microbiol Spectr,10,3,e0024222,,10.1128/spectrum.00242-22,35647875,#3083,Zhao 2022,Exclusion reason: No report of parameters (including seroprevalance and other measures of interest) or transmission or historical outbreaks; Christian Morgenstern (2024-10-16 02:29:48)(Select): Substitution rate in Figure S1 in appendix; Tristan Naidoo (2024-10-12 21:42:18)(Screen): Evolutionary rate or mutations??; ,""

Bats are reservoir to viruses causing Ebola virus diseases (EBV) (Leroy et al., 2005), Nipah Encephalitis (NiV) (Chua et al., 2002), SARS(Li et al., 2005) and MERS-CoV (Yang et al., 2015) being the latest one making headlines. About 18 years ago, a major outbreak of Nipah virus encephalitis occurred in Peninsular Malaysia resulted in the deaths of 105 persons and the slaughter of approximately 1.1 million pigs. In 2006, a novel bat orthoreovirus was found to be associated with acute respiratory syndrome in Malaysia. Following that incidents, many studies have been done on bats, particularly to determine their species, behaviour, and antibody level and there were also studies in human on antibody prevalence to batsrelated viruses e.g. Nipah and Hendra and PRV. Humans may become infected with viruses from bats through intermediate host (swine, horse) or through aerosol or direct contact with bats. Communities living adjacent to bat roosts should aware of possible risk of infection transmission from bats. An earlier study in Guatemala demonstrated that risk of exposure to bats in communities near bats roosts was common, but recognition of the potential for disease transmission from bats was low (Moran et al., 2015). Surprisingly, there is no local published data on public awareness towards bats-related infection despite potential risk of getting the infection.

Immune cell populations were quantified and compared between survivors (up to 4 months post onset day of illness) and healthy controls. Statistical analysis was performed to explore associations between immune profiles and clinical outcomes.

It can cause severe respiratory and neurological diseases in humans, with varying clinical symptoms. Recognized as a critical public health concern by the World Health Organization, it requires concerted efforts in research and development to prevent outbreaks. METHODOLOGY: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted on 455 healthcare workers across four major regions in Bangladesh from April 2022 to May 2023. Using multistage convenient sampling and face-to-face interviews with a semi-structured questionnaire, we have examined the level of knowledge, attitudes, and individual perceptions of the preparedness for NiV. Data analysis included univariate and bivariate analyses, followed by binary logistic regression to ascertain the association with demographic factors. RESULTS: The study identified a gender disparity favoring female healthcare workers (HCWs). Approximately 46.15 % of participants demonstrated a good knowledge about NiV, with doctors showing significantly higher knowledge odds (OR = 5.197, p < 0.001). Interestingly, graduate and post-graduate education levels did not yield a statistically significant correlation with knowledge. Specific training received was positively associated with knowledge levels (OR = 1.832, p = 0.014), highlighting the gap in routine infection prevention education. Regional differences were notable, with participants from Chittagong having a lower level of knowledge compared to Dhaka (OR = 0.307, p = 0.004). Attitudes towards NiV were predominantly positive, although higher education inversely correlated with positive attitudes, suggesting a potential gap between theoretical knowledge and practical attitudes. CONCLUSION: While the attitude towards NiV is generally positive among Bangladeshi HCWs, there is a need to enhance knowledge levels, especially in primary care settings and certain regions. To effectively prepare for NiV outbreaks, it is crucial to prioritize continuous education and practical training.

A Comparative Assessment of the Pathogenic Potential of Newly Discovered Henipaviruses.,Meier K; Olejnik J; Hume AJ; Mühlberger E,"Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have led to the discovery of a plethora of previously unknown viruses in animal samples. Some of these newly detected viruses are closely related to human pathogens. A prime example are the henipaviruses. Both Nipah (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) cause severe disease in humans. Henipaviruses are of zoonotic origin, and animal hosts, including intermediate hosts, play a critical role in viral transmission to humans. The natural reservoir hosts of NiV and HeV seem to be restricted to a few fruit bat species of the Pteropus genus in distinct geographic areas. However, the recent discovery of novel henipa- and henipa-like viruses suggests that these viruses are far more widespread than was originally thought. To date, these new viruses have been found in a wide range of animal hosts, including bats, shrews, and rodents in Asia, Africa, Europe, and South America.

A comparative genomic approach to decipher the mutations associated with Nipah viral human isolates from southeast Asia.,Dsouza NN; Chellasamy SK,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Multiple outbreaks over two decades and a high mortality rate have emphasized the Nipah virus (NiV) as a priority research area. The study focuses on identifying the mutational landscape in sequences from NiV human isolates from different geographical regions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven NiV genomes of human samples from Malaysia, Bangladesh, and India were subjected to phylogeny and metagenomic analysis to decipher the genome variability using MEGA11 software and the meta-CATS web server. Using the Single-Likelihood Ancestor Counting method, the synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations among NiV genes were identified. Further, the nonsynonymous variations were used to identify mutations in all the NiV proteins. RESULTS: The NiV isolates were categorized into NiV-M, NiV-B, and NiV-I clades based on phylogenetic analysis. Metagenomic analysis revealed 1636 variations in the noncoding and coding regions of the genomes of the three clades of NiV. Further analysis of nonsynonymous mutations showed the phosphoprotein to be highly mutating, whereas the matrix protein was stable. CONCLUSION: Deciphering the mutation pattern using a comparative genomics approach for human isolates provided valuable insight into the stability of NiV proteins which can be further used for understanding variations in host-pathogen interaction and developing effective therapeutic measures.",2024,Feb,Iran J Microbiol,16,1,104-113,,10.18502/ijm.v16i1.14879,38682059,#3221,Dsouza 2024,Exclusion reason: No report of parameters (including seroprevalance and other measures of interest) or transmission or historical outbreaks; ,""
Drivers of zoonotic disease risk in the Indian subcontinent: A scoping review.,Durrance-Bagale A; Rudge JW; Singh NB; Belmain SR; Howard N,"Literature on potential anthropogenic drivers of zoonotic disease risk in the Indian subcontinent is sparse. We conducted a scoping review to identify primary sources, published 2000-2020, to clarify what research exists and on which areas future research should focus. We summarised findings thematically by disease. Of 80 sources included, 78 (98%) were original research articles and two were conference abstracts. Study designs and methods were not always clearly described, but 74 (93%) were quantitative (including one randomised trial), five (6%) were mixed-methods, and one was qualitative. Most sources reported research from India (39%) or Bangladesh (31%), followed by Pakistan (9%), Nepal (9%), Bhutan and Sri Lanka (6% each). Topically, most focused on rabies (18; 23%), Nipah virus (16; 20%) or leptospirosis (11; 14%), while 12 (15%) did not focus on a disease but instead on knowledge in communities. People generally did not seek post-exposure prophylaxis for rabies even when vaccination programmes were available and they understood that rabies was fatal, instead often relying on traditional medicines. Similarly, people did not take precautions to protect themselves from leptospirosis infection, even when they were aware of the link with rice cultivation. Nipah was correlated with presence of bats near human habitation. Official information on diseases, modes of transmission and prevention was lacking, or shared informally between friends, relatives, and neighbours. Behaviour did not correspond to disease knowledge. This review identifies various human behaviours which may drive zoonotic disease risk in the Indian subcontinent. Increasing community knowledge and awareness alone is unlikely to be sufficient to successfully change these behaviours. Further research, using interdisciplinary and participatory methods, would improve understanding of risks and risk perceptions and thus help in co-designing context-specific, relevant interventions.",2021,Dec,One Health,13,,100310,,10.1016/j.onehlt.2021.100310,34458546,#3246,Durrance-Bagale 2021,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper
Nipah virus and implications for the nursing workforce and public health: A rapid review.,Cubelo F; Kohanová D; Turunen H; Solgajová A; Berdida DJ,"BACKGROUND: The Nipah virus has raised significant concerns in global health security. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the nursing workforce continues to face numerous challenges, including inadequate preparedness for pandemics, a shortage of nursing personnel, physical, and mental exhaustion. OBJECTIVE: This rapid review aimed to synthesize existing literature on the Nipah virus and its implications for the nursing workforce. DESIGN: A rapid review was conducted to synthesize the available literature on the Nipah virus, facilitating the provision of timely and pertinent information to policymakers and decision influencers. A systematic search strategy was implemented between January 22 and February 9, 2024, from PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCO), Scopus, and Google Scholar without year limitation. Out of 149 studies, six studies were evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklists, and one study was excluded based on this evaluation, resulting in five studies being included. Then these were reviewed using narrative synthesis. The study adhered to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: The selected research indicated that the virus was transmitted throughout the community and during hospital admissions, resulting in unexpected mortality. The healthcare staff, especially nurses, had a limited understanding of the infection. Although there is a lack of confidence in policy and decision-makers, many public health initiatives have been implemented such as providing education on infection prevention and control methods to healthcare personnel, including nurses and support staff. CONCLUSION: There is a need to integrate continuing professional development programs in both primary health care and specialized medical care to strengthen the preparedness of healthcare personnel for future pandemics.

A cross-sectional survey on fruit bat-human interaction in Pakistan; one health perspective.,Ahmed T; Amjad OB; Ahmed H; Ahmed S; Ansari JA; Ricketson R; Tahir MF,"OBJECTIVE: Several factors, such as residential area topography, population density, and lack of infrastructure, were hypothesized to contribute toward respondents' knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding disease transmission. The present study was designed to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and perception of human-fruit bat interaction by student respondents located in ten districts within the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces in Pakistan. METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was conducted by trained enumerators in academic institutions using a structured questionnaire among student respondents (n = 1466), living in two topographically distinct (Mountainous and Plain) residential regions of the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) provinces in Pakistan regarding their history of bat encounters. RESULTS: Our study revealed that 71.4% of the 1466 respondents had observed bats in their geographic region. 21% of our survey respondents reported bat bites incidents over their lifetime, but only 40% actively sought medical care for wound management despite reporting they had a close family member that had contracted rabies (27-35%). Our generalized linear models (GLMs) highlighted that a respondent residing in a residential region had a greater association with reporting a suspected bat bite over their lifetime and reported rabies victims in both near and extended family members (OR = -0,85, p-value = 0.03, 95% CI). This appeared to be due to delaying consulting a doctor or medical facility for treatment following a suspected bat bite in the topographic residential group as compared to the respondents in the provincial residential group (OR 1.12, p-value = 0.04, 95% CI).

An Overview of Anthropogenic Actions as Drivers for Emerging and Re-Emerging Zoonotic Diseases.,Tazerji SS; Nardini R; Safdar M; Shehata AA; Duarte PM,"Population growth and industrialization have led to a race for greater food and supply productivity. As a result, the occupation and population of forest areas, contact with wildlife and their respective parasites and vectors, the trafficking and consumption of wildlife, the pollution of water sources, and the accumulation of waste occur more frequently. Concurrently, the agricultural and livestock production for human consumption has accelerated, often in a disorderly way, leading to the deforestation of areas that are essential for the planet's climatic and ecological balance. The effects of human actions on other ecosystems such as the marine ecosystem cause equally serious damage, such as the pollution of this habitat, and the reduction of the supply of fish and other animals, causing the coastal population to move to the continent. The sum of these factors leads to an increase in the demands such as housing, basic sanitation, and medical assistance, making these populations underserved and vulnerable to the effects of global warming and to the emergence of emerging and re-emerging diseases. In this article, we discuss the anthropic actions such as climate changes, urbanization, deforestation, the trafficking and eating of wild animals, as well as unsustainable agricultural intensification which are drivers for emerging and re-emerging of zoonotic pathogens such as viral (Ebola virus, hantaviruses, Hendravirus, Nipah virus, rabies, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease-2), bacterial (leptospirosis, Lyme borreliosis, and tuberculosis), parasitic (leishmaniasis) and fungal pathogens, which pose a substantial threat to the global community. Finally, we shed light on the urgent demand for the implementation of the One Health concept as a collaborative global approach to raise awareness and educate people about the science behind and the battle against zoonotic pathogens to mitigate the threat for both humans and animals.",2022,Nov,Pathogens,11,11,,,10.3390/pathogens11111376,36422627,#3332,Tazerji 2022,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper
Nipah Virus Mystery: Insight into Transmission and Mechanism of Disease Progression,"Hassan, D; Ravindran, R; Hossain, A","Nipah virus (NiV) belongs to the biosafety level four (BSL-4) group of human pathogens of zoonotic origin. It is an emerging pathogen capable of causing a variety of clinical presentations, including encephalitis and severe acute respiratory illness, which can be fatal. Interestingly, it can also cause asymptomatic infections, which can relapse after a long period of time ranging from months to years following initial infection. Zoonotic transmission involves bats or pigs. In addition, transmission via contaminated food and occasional human to human direct transmission may also occur. It can have diverse epidemiological features and can have a very high case fatality ratio. Although a variety of immunological and molecular assays have been developed and epidemiological monitoring procedures for this disease have been introduced, there are no drugs available for this virus. Vaccines are at different stages of development. In this mini-review, we present the latest information on the Nipah virus; primarily focusing on emergence, transmission, pathogenic mechanisms and possible prophylactic and treatment options.",2022,,JOURNAL OF PURE AND APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY,16,1,26-34,WOS:000766786800005,10.22207/JPAM.16.1.72,,#3349,Hassan 2022,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper
What is stirring in the reservoir? Modelling mechanisms of henipavirus circulation in fruit bat hosts,"Glennon, EE; Becker, DJ; Peel, AJ; Garnier, R; Suu-Ire, RD; Gibson, L; Hayman, DTS; Wood, JLN; Cunningham, AA; Plowright, RK; Restif, O","Pathogen circulation among reservoir hosts is a precondition for zoonotic spillover. Unlike the acute, high morbidity infections typical in spillover hosts, infected reservoir hosts often exhibit low morbidity and mortality. Although it has been proposed that reservoir host infections may be persistent with recurrent episodes of shedding, direct evidence is often lacking. We construct a generalized SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) framework encompassing 46 sub-models representing the full range of possible transitions among those four states of infection and immunity. We then use likelihood-based methods to fit these models to nine years of longitudinal data on henipavirus serology from a captive colony of Eidolon helvum bats in Ghana. We find that reinfection is necessary to explain observed dynamics; that acute infectious periods may be very short (hours to days); that immunity, if present, lasts about 1-2 years; and that recurring latent infection is likely. Although quantitative inference is sensitive to assumptions about serology, qualitative predictions are robust. Our novel approach helps clarify mechanisms of viral persistence and circulation in wild bats, including estimated ranges for key parameters such as the basic reproduction number and the duration of the infectious period.

Research to understand the high-risk behaviors associated with disease transmission at the human-animal interface is limited, and few consider regional and local contexts. Objective This study employed an integrated behavioral-biological surveillance approach for the early detection of novel and known zoonotic viruses in potentially high-risk populations, in an effort to identify risk factors for spillover and to determine potential foci for risk-mitigation measures. Method Participants were enrolled at two community-based sites (n = 472) in eastern and western Thailand and two hospital (clinical) sites (n = 206) in northeastern and central Thailand. A behavioral questionnaire was administered to understand participants' demographics, living conditions, health history, and animal-contact behaviors and attitudes. Biological specimens were tested for coronaviruses, filoviruses, flaviviruses, influenza viruses, and paramyxoviruses using pan (consensus) RNA Virus assays. Results Overall 61/678 (9%) of participants tested positive for the viral families screened which included influenza viruses (75%), paramyxoviruses (15%), human coronaviruses (3%), flaviviruses (3%), and enteroviruses (3%). The most salient predictors of reporting unusual symptoms (i.e., any illness or sickness that is not known or recognized in the community or diagnosed by medical providers) in the past year were having other household members who had unusual symptoms and being scratched or bitten by animals in the same year. Many participants reported raising and handling poultry (10.3% and 24.2%), swine (2%, 14.6%), and cattle (4.9%, 7.8%) and several participants also reported eating raw or undercooked meat of these animals (2.2%, 5.5%, 10.3% respectively). Twenty four participants (3.5%) reported handling bats or having bats in the house roof. Gender, age, and livelihood activities were shown to be significantly associated with participants' interactions with animals. Participants' knowledge of risks influenced their health-seeking behavior. Conclusion The results suggest that there is a high level of interaction between humans, livestock, and wild animals in communities at sites we investigated in Thailand.

Enhanced accuracy and reliability in predicting Nipah virus outbreaks with Type-1 and Type-2 fuzzy sets,"Leelavathi, N; Dhavamani, M","Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic pathogen with high mortality rates, posing significant public health threats in South and Southeast Asia. Traditional outbreak prediction models often fall short in handling the complexities and uncertainties inherent in epidemiological data. This research introduces a novel predictive model that integrates Type-1 and Type-2 fuzzy sets within a hierarchical fuzzy inference system (FIS) to enhance the accuracy and reliability of Nipah virus outbreak predictions. The model leverages enriched sequencing techniques to achieve higher and more consistent genomic coverage, leading to precise variant detection and robust genomic analysis. Comprehensive geographical and temporal data integration allows for the identification of outbreak hotspots and virus evolution patterns. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves predictive accuracy, with a mean squared error (MSE) of 512, compared to traditional models. The enriched sequencing method reduced variability in minor variant detection, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the virus's genetic diversity. This approach provides valuable insights for targeted public health interventions and resource allocation, highlighting the importance of adaptive surveillance strategies.

Pandemic potential of henipaviruses,"Wojtkiewicz, A; Szota, M; Kedziora-Kornatowska, K","Introduction and purpose. Hendra and Nipah are two highly dangerous zoonotic viruses belonging to the group of henipaviruses. Although they have been known for over 20 years, no human drug or vaccine has been invented. This paper aims to to describe the epidemiology of the reported paramyxoviruses, the pandemic potential of henipaviruses, and a standardised action plan to counter their spread. This paper reviews scientifi c articles from 2012-2023 published in scientifi c databases such as Pubmed, Researchgate, and Google Scholar. The keywords used were pandemic potential of henipaviruses, Hendra virus, Nipah virus, and henipavirus epidemics. State of knowledge description. The mortality rate of henipaviruses varies between 50 and 100%. The Nipah virus is particularly dangerous, with epidemics recurring virtually every year in Asia since 1998. The Hendra virus situation may be manageable because there is an effective vaccine for horses most vulnerable to infection. Due to human activity, the habitats and climate of the animals serving as virus reservoirs are changing. Because of frequent henipavirus outbreaks in Asia and Australia, extensive efforts are being made to contain and neutralise them rapidly. Conclusions. As henipaviruses pose a high pandemic threat, more research into drugs and vaccines is required. It is also essential to develop effective bio-assurance plans, introduce controls on their operation and educate the population on the issue. Reservoir animals, through anthropogenic environmental changes, are changing habitats and feeding sites, making more and more territories vulnerable to the disease. New species of henipaviruses constantly emerge and pose an epizootic challenge to public health. Hence, an essential action is to increase the amount of research into the virus's epidemic development and conduct it as widely as possible.",2024,,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE,93,1,50-56,WOS:001222769400005,10.20883/medical.e929,,#3453,Wojtkiewicz 2024,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper

The Nipah virus (NiV) belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family was reported in Malaysia in 1998/1999. Due to its high mortality in humans, its zoonotic nature, the possibility of human-to-human transmission, and the lack of an available vaccine, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recognized it as a global health problem. Depending on strain specificity, neurological symptoms and severe respiratory disorders are observed in NiV infection. In most confirmed cases of NiV epidemics, the appearance of the virus in humans was associated with the presence of various animal species, but generally, bats of Pteropus species are considered the most important natural animal NiV reservoir and vector.

"Nipah Virus Disease: Epidemiological, Clinical, Diagnostic and Legislative Aspects of This Unpredictable Emerging Zoonosis","Bruno, L; Nappo, MA; Ferrari, L; Di Lecce, R; Guarnieri, C; Cantoni, AM; Corradi, A","Nipah virus (NiV) infection is a viral disease caused by a Henipavirus, belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family, responsible for a zoonosis. The course of the disease can be very serious and lead to death. NiV natural hosts are fruit bats (also known as megabats) belonging to the Pteropodidae family, especially those of the Pteropus genus. Natural infection in domestic animals has been described in farming pigs, horses, domestic and feral dogs and cats. Natural NiV transmission is possible intra-species (pig-to-pig, human-to-human) and inter-species (flying bat-to-human, pig-to-human, horse-to-human). The infection can be spread by humans or animals in different ways. It is peculiar how the viral transmission modes among different hosts also change depending on the geographical area for different reasons, including different breeding methods, eating habits and the recently identified genetic traits/molecular features of main virus proteins related to virulence. Outbreaks have been described in Malaysia, Singapore, Bangladesh, India and the Philippines with, in some cases, severe respiratory and neurological disease and high mortality in both humans and pigs. Diagnosis can be made using different methods including serological, molecular, virological and immunohistochemical methods. The cornerstones for control of the disease are biosecurity (via the correct management of reservoir and intermediate/amplifying hosts) and potential vaccines which are still under development. However, the evaluation of the potential influence of climate and anthropogenic changes on the NiV reservoir bats and their habitat as well as on disease spread and inter-specific infections is of great importance. Bats, as natural reservoirs of the virus, are responsible for the viral spread and, therefore, for the outbreaks of the disease in humans and animals. Due to the worldwide distribution of bats, potential new reports and spillovers are not to be dismissed in the future.",2023,,ANIMALS,13,1,,WOS:000909769000001,10.3390/ani13010159,,#3482,Bruno 2023,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper
NIPAH -Virus: A review,"Mahavir, J; Sukhminderjit, K; Vipin, D; Aastha, M","Zoonotic diseases have the potential to cause an epidemic in a short time period and due to changing ecological and environmental conditions, zoonoses have been on the rise posing a threat to human health. The emergence of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1998-99 is a classical example of emerging zoonosis. Following the outbreak in Malaysia, there were major cases of NIPAH in India and Bangladesh throughout the past two decades with high fatality rate. The natural host of the virus was found to be a species of fruit eating bats i.e. Pteropus bat also known as flying fox. The major sources of infection amongst humans were raw date palm sap and pigs which were infected by fluids present inside Pteropus bats. The most affected were Asian countries but similar virus was also found in bats across African subcontinent. Nipah infection can be diagnosed in laboratory throughout the critical and rejuvenating stages of the infection by appointing various test combinations. NiV infections in humans and animals are diagnosed by various tests such as virus isolation, serological tests and nucleic acid amplification tests. Since Nipah is highly dangerous and potentially pathogenic contaminant, appropriate cautions have to be appointed while assorting, submitting and handling the sample.All the work related to Nipah has to be carried out in physical contaminant level. Till date no vaccine has been produced against Nipah virus due to limited experimental conditions, so certain measures could only be taken to prevent against Nipah virus, however the studies are in progress. A vaccine has been developed in Australia for protection of horses against the similar virus i.e. Hendra virus. The vaccine uses Hendra G protein and produces cross protective antibodies against HeV and NiV. Due to no licensed antibodies, only precautions can be taken to prevent infection by Nipah virus.",2020,,RESEARCH JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY,15,5,143-153,WOS:000529376100020,,,#3488,Mahavir 2020,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper

The initial emergence of NiV infections in pigs and humans in Malaysia, and HeV infections in horses and humans in Australia, posed severe impacts on human and animal health, and continues threatening lives of humans and livestock within Southeast Asia and Australia. Recently, henipavirus-specific antibodies have also been detected in fruit bats in a number of sub-Saharan African countries and in Brazil, thereby considerably increasing the known geographic distribution of henipaviruses. Africa is progressively being recognized as a new high prevalence zone for henipaviruses, as deduced from serological and molecular evidence of past infections in Madagascar, Ghana, Republic of Congo, Gulf of Guinea, Zambia, Tanzania, Cameroon, and Nigeria lately. Serological data suggest henipavirus spillover from bats to livestock and human populations in Africa without reported clinical disease in any of these species. All virus isolation attempts have been abortive, highlighting the need for further investigations.

Potential pandemic pathogens series: Nipah virus,"Evers, S; Nederstigt, C; van Paassen, J; van Westerloo, DJ","In the last two years we have experienced the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in our lives and hospitals. Pandemics are part of the history of humanity and we can be certain that in the future new pandemics will appear. In fact, due to the growth in the human population, increased travel and global warming, it is to be expected that new pandemic pathogens will arise more frequently than before. Additionally, decreased barriers between animals and humans will give rise to spillover events which may result in the introduction of new zoonotic pathogens in humans. In each of the parts of this series we will, in a short format, highlight a potential pandemic pathogen and describe its characteristics, history and potential for global pandemics. In this part of the series we focus on the Nipah virus. Nipah virus is currently on the WHO's list of global priority pathogens as it possesses pandemic properties, is highly infectious and potentially fatal.

Immunopathogenesis of Nipah Virus Infection and Associated Immune Responses,"Brown, B; Gravier, T; Fricke, I; Al-Sheboul, SA; Carp, TN; Leow, CY; Imarogbe, C; Arabpour, J","Pandemics in the last two centuries have been initiated by causal pathogens that include Severe Acute Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Influenza (e.g., the H1N1 pandemic of 2009). The latter is considered to have initiated two prior pandemics in 1918 and 1977, known as the ""Spanish Flu"" and ""Russian Flu"", respectively. Here, we discuss other emerging infections that could be potential public health threats. These include Henipaviruses, which are members of the family Paramyxoviridae that infect bats and other mammals. Paramyxoviridae also include Parainfluenza and Mumps viruses (Rubulavirus) but also Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV) (Pneumovirus). Additionally included is the Measles virus, recorded for the first time in writing in 1657 (Morbillivirus). In humans and animals, these may cause encephalitis or respiratory diseases. Recently, two more highly pathogenic class 4 viral pathogens emerged. These were named Hendra Henipavirus (HeV) and Nipah Henipavirus (NiV). Nipah virus is a negative-sense single-stranded ribonucleic acid ((-) ssRNA) virus within the family Paramyxoviridae. There are currently no known therapeutics or treatment regimens licensed as effective in humans, with development ongoing. Nipah virus is a lethal emerging zoonotic disease that has been neglected since its characterization in 1999 until recently. Nipah virus infection occurs predominantly in isolated regions of Malaysia, Bangladesh, and India in small outbreaks. Factors that affect animal-human disease transmission include viral mutation, direct contact, amplifying reservoirs, food, close contact, and host cell mutations. There are different strains of Nipah virus, and small outbreaks in humans limit known research and surveillance on this pathogen. The small size of outbreaks in rural areas is suggestive of low transmission. Person-to-person transmission may occur. The role that zoonotic (animal-human) or host immune system cellular factors perform therefore requires analysis. Mortality estimates for NiV infection range from 38-100% (averaging 58.2% in early 2019). It is therefore critical to outline treatments and prevention for NiV disease in future research. The final stages of the disease severely affect key organ systems, particularly the central nervous system and brain. Therefore, here we clarify the pathogenesis, biochemical mechanisms, and all research in context with known immune cell proteins and genetic factors.",2023,,IMMUNO,3,2,160-181,WOS:001119914400001,10.3390/immuno3020011,,#3507,Brown 2023,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper

The 'One Health' Approach to an Epidemic Response,"Cherian, V; Philip, J","The concept of 'one health' recognizes that there is an inextricable link between the health of people, animals, and the shared environment. With the rapid growth in population and the destruction of natural habitats, humans are coming into closer contact with wild and domesticated animals. This, in turn, creates ripe conditions for the movement of viruses and diseases between animals and people. The world is seeing frequent occurrences of epidemics caused by new pathogens, to which humans have little immunity, owing to this phenomenon. 'One Health' assumes global significance today when the world is in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic.The response of the state of Kerala to the COVID-19 crisis is guided by its prior experience with curbing the Nipah virus epidemic in 2018. The same core philosophy of 'one health' that was at the heart of the campaign to rein in the Nipah outbreak has spearheaded the state response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A review of available literature in Pubmed/Medline & Google scholar databases was carried out to study the impact of 'one health' on the epidemic response of Kerala state to the Nipah virus, and how it has been extrapolated in managing the current COVID-19 pandemic.

"A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW ON VIRAL ZOONOSIS: EMPHASIZING ON PATHOGENESIS, DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT, PREVENTION STRATEGIES AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES","Jain, N; Saiju, P; Jain, R","Zoonoses are human diseases caused by animal pathogens or animal diseases that are transmissible to humans. They are caused by all types of pathogenic agents, including bacteria, parasites, fungi, viruses, and prions. Zoonotic diseases can be transmitted to humans by infected saliva, aerosols, contaminated urine or feces, and direct contact with the animal or pathogenic microbes. Furthermore, transmission can also occur through animal vectors (e.g., tick bite, and insects like mosquitoes or flea). The zoonotic microbes continue to evolve and adapt with tremendous acceleration and expansion of global trade, human movement, and population. Control of zoonotic diseases and protection of public health are challenging tasks as the world population is increasing proportionately. Newly emerging viruses such as the Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-coronavirus, and the avian influenza virus, H1N1 virus, Nipah virus, Zika Virus, and now Covid-19 are serious threats to public health and have become a global concern. The prevention of these infections depends on improved diagnosis and highly effective therapeutics/prophylactics.

Incorporating these complex processes in transmission dynamic models can help inform policy and disease control interventions. We identified 20 diseases involving environmentally persistent pathogens (ie, pathogens that survive for more than 48 h in the environment and can cause subsequent human infections), of which indirect transmission can occur from animals to humans via the environment. Using a systematic approach, we critically appraised dynamic transmission models for environmentally persistent zoonotic diseases to quantify traits of models across diseases. 210 transmission modelling studies were identified and most studies considered diseases of domestic animals or high-income settings, or both. We found that less than half of studies validated their models to real-world data, and environmental data on pathogen persistence was rarely incorporated.

Hendra Virus Infection in Horses: A Review on Emerging Mystery Paramyxovirus,"Khusro, A; Aarti, C; Pliego, AB; Cipriano-Salazar, M","Hendra virus (HeV) is a zoonotic paramyxovirus which causes acute and deadly infection in horses (Equus caballus). It is a rare and unmanaged emerging viral infection in horses which is harbored by bats of the genus Pteropus (Australian flying foxes or fruit bats). The virus is pleomorphic in shape and its genome contains nonsegmented negative-stranded RNA with 18234 nucleotides in length. The virus is transmitted from flying foxes to horses, horse to horse, and horse to humans. Human-to-human transmission of HeV infection is not reported yet. The infection of HeV in horses is highly variable and shows broad range of signs and lesions including distinct respiratory and neurological disorders. Currently, there are no specific antiviral drugs available for the treatment of HeV infection in horses. Vaccination is considered as prime option to prevent HeV infection in horses. A subunit vaccine, called as ""Equivac HeV vaccine"" has been approved recently for preventing this viral infection in horses. In addition, a plethora of common preventive strategies could help restrict the inter- and intra-species transmission of HeV. Considering the scanty but severe fatality cases of this mystery virus as well as lack of proper attention by veterinary scientists, this review article spotlights not only on the clinical signs, transmission, epidemiology, biology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis of HeV but also the preventive managements of this uncommon infection in horses by vaccination and other precautious strategies.

Bat-borne viruses in Africa: a critical review,"Markotter, W; Coertse, J; De Vries, L; Geldenhuys, M; Mortlock, M","In Africa, bat-borne zoonoses emerged in the past few decades resulting in large outbreaks or just sporadic spillovers. In addition, hundreds of more viruses are described without any information on zoonotic potential. We discuss important characteristics of bats including bat biology, evolution, distribution and ecology that not only make them unique among most mammals but also contribute to their potential as viral reservoirs. The detection of a virus in bats does not imply that spillover will occur and several biological, ecological and anthropogenic factors play a role in such an event. We summarize and critically analyse the current knowledge on African bats as reservoirs for corona-, filo-, paramyxo- and lyssaviruses. We highlight that important information on epidemiology, bat biology and ecology is often not available to make informed decisions on zoonotic spillover potential. Even if knowledge gaps exist, it is still important to recognize the role of bats in zoonotic disease outbreaks and implement mitigation strategies to prevent exposure to infectious agents including working safely with bats. Equally important is the crucial role of bats in various ecosystem services.

Viral Hyperparasitism in Bat Ectoparasites: Implications for Pathogen Maintenance and Transmission,"Tendu, A; Hughes, AC; Berthet, N; Wong, G","Humans continue to encroach on the habitats of wild animals, potentially bringing different species into contact that would not typically encounter each other under natural circumstances, and forcing them into stressful, suboptimal conditions. Stressors from unsustainable human land use changes are suspected to dramatically exacerbate the probability of zoonotic spillover of pathogens from their natural reservoir hosts to humans, both by increasing viral load (and shedding) and the interface between wildlife with livestock, pets and humans. Given their known role as reservoir hosts, bats continue to be investigated for their possible role as the origins of many viral outbreaks. However, the participation of bat-associated ectoparasites in the spread of potential pathogens requires further work to establish. Here, we conducted a comprehensive review of viruses, viral genes and other viral sequences obtained from bat ectoparasites from studies over the last four decades. This review summarizes research findings of the seven virus families in which these studies have been performed, including Paramyxoviridae, Reoviridae, Flaviviridae, Peribunyaviridae, Nairoviridae, Rhabdoviridae and Filoviridae.

Temporal and spatial limitations in global surveillance for bat filoviruses and henipaviruses,"Becker, DJ; Crowley, DE; Washburne, AD; Plowright, RK","Sampling reservoir hosts over time and space is critical to detect epizootics, predict spillover and design interventions. However, because sampling is logistically difficult and expensive, researchers rarely perform spatio-temporal sampling of many reservoir hosts. Bats are reservoirs of many virulent zoonotic pathogens such as filoviruses and henipaviruses, yet the highly mobile nature of these animals has limited optimal sampling of bat populations. To quantify the frequency of temporal sampling and to characterize the geographical scope of bat virus research, we here collated data on filovirus and henipavirus prevalence and seroprevalence in wild bats. We used a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis to next assess temporal and spatial variation in bat virus detection estimates. Our analysis shows that only one in four bat virus studies report data longitudinally, that sampling efforts cluster geographically (e.g. filovirus data are available across much of Africa and Asia but are absent from Latin America and Oceania), and that sampling designs and reporting practices may affect some viral detection estimates (e.g. filovirus seroprevalence). Within the limited number of longitudinal bat virus studies, we observed high heterogeneity in viral detection estimates that in turn reflected both spatial and temporal variation. This suggests that spatio-temporal sampling designs are important to understand how zoonotic viruses are maintained and spread within and across wild bat populations, which in turn could help predict and preempt risks of zoonotic viral spillover.",2019,,BIOLOGY LETTERS,15,12,,WOS:000502160500004,10.1098/rsbl.2019.0423,,#3978,Becker 2019,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper

We analyzed the virome of a group of Myotis fimbriatus bats collected from the Yunnan Province during 2020. The virome of M. fimbriatus revealed the presence of families of pathogenic viruses such as Coronavirus, Astrovirus, Mastadenovirus, and Picornavirus, among others. The viral sequences identified in M. fimbriatus were characterized by significant divergence from other known viral sequences of bat origin. Complex phylogenetic landscapes implying a tendency of co-specificity and relationships with viruses from other mammals characterize these groups. The most prevalent and abundant virus in M. fimbriatus individuals was an alphacoronavirus.

Flying foxes are the wildlife reservoir from which the virus was first isolated in 1996. Following a heat stress mortality event in Australian flying foxes in 2013, a novel HeV variant was discovered. This study describes the subsequent surveillance of Australian flying foxes for this novel virus over a nine year period using qRT-PCR testing of tissues from flying foxes submitted primarily for Australian bat lyssavirus diagnosis. Genome sequencing and characterisation of the novel HeV variant was also undertaken. Methods Spleen and kidney samples harvested from flying fox carcasses were initially screened with two real-time qRT-PCR assays specific for the prototype HeV. Two additional qRT-PCR assays were developed specific for the HeV variant first detected in samples from a flying fox in 2013. Next-generation sequencing and virus isolation was attempted from selected samples to further characterise the new virus. Results Since 2013, 98 flying foxes were tested and 11 were positive for the new HeV variant. No samples were positive for the original HeV. Ten of the positive samples were from grey-headed flying foxes (GHFF, Pteropus poliocephalus), however this species was over-represented in the opportunistic sampling (83% of bats tested were GHFF). The positive GHFF samples were collected from Victoria and South Australia and one positive Little red flying fox (LRFF, Pteropus scapulatus) was collected from Western Australia. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of henipavirus antigen, associated with an inflammatory lesion in cardiac blood vessels of one GHFF. Positive samples were sequenced and the complete genome was obtained from three samples. When compared to published HeV genomes, there was 84% sequence identity at the nucleotide level. Based on phylogenetic analyses, the newly detected HeV belongs to the HeV species but occupies a distinct lineage. We have therefore designated this virus HeV genotype 2 (HeV-g2).

Ecology of bats and their role in emerging zoonotic diseases: a review,"Biswas, R; Debnath, C; Samanta, ; Barua, R; Singh, AD","The order Chiroptera is the second largest order of mammals and shows great physiological and ecological diversity. These animals play significant ecological roles as prey and predator as well as facilitating pollination, seed dispersal, arthropod reduction and nutrient distribution and reutilisation in nature. Bats act as hosts to a range of viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic zoonoses. Human activities increase the likelihood of exposure to bats, thereby increasing the opportunity for infections to spill over. Continuing ecological processes, emergence and spillover of novel pathogens in naive hosts, including humans, along with other complex natural phenomena require proper understanding that may help in predicting the next spillover. This review will discuss the ecology of bats and their role in the emergence of different zoonoses, particularly those of viral origin, in an organised manner to increase understanding of the factors that may play significant roles in spillover of these pathogens from bats to other animals, including humans.",2020,,REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES,39,3,1077-1090,WOS:000770919000034,10.20506/rst.39.3.3198,,#3988,Biswas 2020,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper
Common Themes in Zoonotic Spillover and Disease Emergence: Lessons Learned from Bat- and Rodent-Borne RNA Viruses,"Williams, EP; Spruill-Harrell, BM; Taylor, MK; Lee, J; Nywening, AV; Yang, ZM; Nichols, JH; Camp, JV; Owen, RD; Jonsson, CB","Rodents (order Rodentia), followed by bats (order Chiroptera), comprise the largest percentage of living mammals on earth. Thus, it is not surprising that these two orders account for many of the reservoirs of the zoonotic RNA viruses discovered to date. The spillover of these viruses from wildlife to human do not typically result in pandemics but rather geographically confined outbreaks of human infection and disease. While limited geographically, these viruses cause thousands of cases of human disease each year. In this review, we focus on three questions regarding zoonotic viruses that originate in bats and rodents. First, what biological strategies have evolved that allow RNA viruses to reside in bats and rodents? Second, what are the environmental and ecological causes that drive viral spillover?

Viral Zoonoses of National Importance in Ghana: Advancements and Opportunities for Enhancing Capacities for Early Detection and Response,"Suu-Ire, RD; Obodai, E; Bonney, JHK; Bel-Nono, SO; Ampofo, W; Kelly, TR","Zoonotic diseases have devastating impacts on human and animal health, livelihoods, and economies. Addressing the complex web of interrelated factors leading to zoonotic disease emergence and spread requires a transdisciplinary, cross-sectoral approach, One Health. The One Health approach, which considers the linkages between the health of people, animals, and their shared environment, presents opportunities to reduce these impacts through a more holistic coordinated strategy to understanding and mitigating disease risks. Understanding the linkages between animal, human, and environmental health risks and outcomes is critical for developing early detection systems and risk reduction strategies to address known and novel zoonotic disease threats. Nearly 70 countries across the world, including Ghana, have signed on to the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), which is facilitating multisectoral approaches to strengthen country capacities in the prevention and early detection of and respond to infectious disease threats. Currently, Ghana has not yet formalized a national One Health policy. The lack of a clearly defined multisectoral platform and limited collaboration among key Ghanaian Ministries, Departments, and Agencies has impacted the country's ability to effectively mitigate and respond to emerging and reemerging zoonoses. Many of these emerging zoonoses are caused by viruses, which, because of their diversity and evolutionary properties, are perceived to pose the greatest threat to global health security.

An Update in Knowledge of Pigs as the Source of Zoonotic Pathogens,"Augustyniak, A; Pomorska-Mól, M","Simple Summary The observed trend of increasing numbers of humans living on the Earth will result in increased demand for food, especially foods of high nutritional value, such as meat. This phenomenon will result in the growth of the livestock population. One of the most commonly consumed foods worldwide is pork. Therefore, it is reasonable to suspect that the pig world population, in the near future, will increase as well. Pigs are prone to infections/invasions with numerous viral, bacterial, and parasitic aetiological factors. Such infections are referred to as zoonotic infections. In view of the growing number of pigs headage, the possible risk of human infection of zoonotic origin seems to be increased. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the most up-to-date data regarding the epidemiology of several of the most significant porcine zoonoses, with available preventive measures to control them.Abstract The available data indicate that the human world population will constantly grow in the subsequent decades. This constant increase in the number of people on the Earth will lead to growth in food demand, especially in food of high nutritional value. Therefore, it is expected that the world livestock population will also increase. Such a phenomenon enhances the risk of transmitting pathogens to humans. As pig production is one of the most significant branches of the world's livestock production, zoonoses of porcine origins seem to be of particular importance. Therefore, in this review, we aim to introduce the latest data concerning, among other things, epidemiology and available preventive measures to control the most significant porcine zoonoses of viral, bacterial, and parasitic origin.",2023,,ANIMALS,13,20,,WOS:001095590900001,10.3390/ani13203281,,#3995,Augustyniak 2023,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper
Crop protection practices and viral zoonotic risks within a One Health framework,"Ratnadass, A; Deguine, JP","Recent viral zoonotic epidemics have been attributed partially to the negative impact of human activities on ecosystem biodiversity. Agricultural activities, particularly conventional crop protection (CP) practices, are a major threat to global biodiversity, ecosystem health and human health. Here we review interactions between CP practices and viral zoonoses (VZs), the first time this has been done. It should be noted that a) VZs stand at the interface between human, animal and ecosystem health; b) some VZs involve arthropod vectors that are affected by CP practices; and c) some crop pests, or their natural enemies are vertebrate reservoirs/carriers of certain VZs, and their contact with humans or domestic animals is affected by CP practices. Our review encompasses examples highlighting interactions between VZs and CP practices, both efficiency improvement-based (i.e. conventional with agrochemical insecticides and rodenticides), substitution-based (i.e. mainly with physical/ mechanical or biopesticidal pest control), and redesign-based (i.e. mainly with conservation biological pest control, including some forms of crop-livestock integration). These CP practices mainly target arthropod and vertebrate pests. They also target, to a lesser extent, weeds and plant pathogens. Conventional and some physical/ mechanical control methods and some forms of biopesticidal and crop-livestock integration practices were found to have mixed outcomes in terms of VZ risk management. Conversely, practices based on biological control by habitat conservation of arthropod or vertebrate natural enemies, falling within the Agroecological Crop Protection (ACP) framework, result in VZ prevention at various scales (local to global, and short-term to longterm). ACP addresses major global challenges including climate resilience, biodiversity conservation and animal welfare, and helps integrate plant health within the extended ""One Health"" concept.

"Bat-associated microbes: Opportunities and perils, an overview","Dhivahar, J; Parthasarathy, A; Krishnan, K; Kovi, BS; Pandian, GN","The potential biotechnological uses of bat-associated bacteria are discussed briefly, indicating avenues for biotechnological applications of bat-associated microbes. The uniqueness of bats in terms of their lifestyle, genomes and molecular immunology may predispose bats to act as disease reservoirs. Molecular phylogenetic analysis has shown several instances of bats harbouring the ancestral lineages of bacterial (Bartonella), protozoal (Plasmodium, Trypanosoma cruei) and viral (SARS-CoV2) pathogens infecting humans. Along with the transmission of viruses from bats, we also discuss the potential roles of bat-associated bacteria, fungi, and protozoan parasites in emerging diseases. Current evidence suggests that environmental changes and interactions between wildlife, livestock, and humans contribute to the spill-over of infectious agents from bats to other hosts. Domestic animals including livestock may act as intermediate amplifying hosts for bat-origin pathogens to transmit to humans. An increasing number of studies investigating bat pathogen diversity and infection dynamics have been published. However, whether or how these infectious agents are transmitted both within bat populations and to other hosts, including humans, often remains unknown. Metagenomic approaches are uncovering the dynamics and distribution of potential pathogens in bat microbiomes, which might improve the understanding of disease emergence and transmission.

This natural mechanism has historically been a diagnostic marker for paramyxovirus infection in vivo and is now widely used for the study of virus-induced membrane fusion in vitro. However, the role of syncytium formation in within-host dissemination and pathogenicity of viruses remains poorly understood. The diversity of henipaviruses and their wide host range and tissue tropism make them particularly appropriate models with which to characterize the drivers of syncytium formation and the implications for virus fitness and pathogenicity. Based on the henipavirus literature, we summarized current knowledge on the mechanisms driving syncytium formation, mostly acquired from in vitro studies, and on the in vivo distribution of syncytia. While these data suggest that syncytium formation widely occurs across henipaviruses, hosts, and tissues, we identified important data gaps that undermined our understanding of the role of syncytium formation in virus pathogenesis. Based on these observations, we propose solutions of varying complexity to fill these data gaps, from better practices in data archiving and publication for in vivo studies, to experimental approaches in vitro.",2021,,VIRUSES-BASEL,13,9,,WOS:000702113700001,10.3390/v13091755,,#4003,Gamble 2021,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper
Risk and Response to Biological Catastrophe in Lower Income Countries,"Luby, S; Arthur, R","Natural and intentional biological risks threaten human civilization, both through direct human fatality as well as follow-on effects from a collapse of the just-in-time delivery system that provides food, energy and critical supplies to communities globally. Human beings have multiple innate cognitive biases that systematically impair careful consideration of these risks. Residents of low-income countries, especially those who live in rural areas and are less dependent upon global trade, may be the most resilient communities to catastrophic risks, but low-income countries also present a heightened risk for biological catastrophe. Hotspots for the emergence of new zoonotic diseases are predominantly located in low-income countries. Crowded, poorly supplied healthcare facilities in low-income countries provide an optimal environment for new pathogens to transmit to a next host and adapt for more efficient person-to-person transmission.

Currently, 78 species, 17 genera, and 4 subfamilies of paramyxoviruses are harbored by multiple natural reservoirs, including rodents, bats, birds, reptiles, and fish. Henipaviruses are critical zoonotic pathogens that cause severe acute respiratory distress and neurological diseases in humans. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, 115 Crocidura species individuals were examined for the prevalence of paramyxovirus infections. Paramyxovirus RNA was observed in 26 (22.6%) shrews collected at five trapping sites, Republic of Korea. Herein, we report two genetically distinct novel paramyxoviruses (genus: Henipavirus): Gamak virus (GAKV) and Daeryong virus (DARV) isolated from C. lasiura and C. shantungensis, respectively. Two GAKVs and one DARV were nearly completely sequenced using next-generation sequencing. GAKV and DARV contain six genes (3 & PRIME;-N-P-M-F-G-L-5 & PRIME;) with genome sizes of 18,460 nucleotides and 19,471 nucleotides, respectively.

Implications of Glycosaminoglycans on Viral Zoonotic Diseases,"Bauer, S; Zhang, FM; Linhardt, RJ","Zoonotic diseases are infectious diseases that pass from animals to humans. These include diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites and can be transmitted through close contact or through an intermediate insect vector. Many of the world's most problematic zoonotic diseases are viral diseases originating from animal spillovers. The Spanish influenza pandemic, Ebola outbreaks in Africa, and the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are thought to have started with humans interacting closely with infected animals. As the human population grows and encroaches on more and more natural habitats, these incidents will only increase in frequency. Because of this trend, new treatments and prevention strategies are being explored. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are complex linear polysaccharides that are ubiquitously present on the surfaces of most human and animal cells. In many infectious diseases, the interactions between GAGs and zoonotic pathogens correspond to the first contact that results in the infection of host cells. In recent years, researchers have made progress in understanding the extraordinary roles of GAGs in the pathogenesis of zoonotic diseases, suggesting potential therapeutic avenues for using GAGs in the treatment of these diseases. This review examines the role of GAGs in the progression, prevention, and treatment of different zoonotic diseases caused by viruses.",2021,,DISEASES,9,4,,WOS:000735541100001,10.3390/diseases9040085,,#4024,Bauer 2021,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper

Suspecting Nipah virus in a NiV naive tropical area is a challenge. NiV management is further confounded by acute presentation, high mortality, broad species tropism, multiple modes of transmission, difficulty to diagnose and lack of definitive treatment.MethodsRecent NiV outbreak that lasted for approximately 1 month (2–29 May 2018) and resulted in 23 cases with a case-fatality rate of 91%. We present clinical summary and management of five cases managed at Baby Memorial Hospital, Kozhikode, India from May 17, 2018 to May 30, 2018 and were epidemiologically linked to the index case.

Bat Viral Shedding: A Review of Seasonal Patterns and Risk Factors,"Niu, YN; Mckee, CD","Background: Bats act as reservoirs for a variety of zoonotic viruses, sometimes leading to spillover into humans and potential risks of global transmission. Viral shedding from bats is an essential prerequisite to bat-to-human viral transmission and understanding the timing and intensity of viral shedding from bats is critical to mitigate spillover risks. However, there are limited investigations on bats' seasonal viral shedding patterns and their related risk factors. We conducted a comprehensive review of longitudinal studies on bat viruses with spillover potential to synthesize patterns of seasonal viral shedding and explore associated risk factors.Methods: We extracted data from 60 reviewed articles and obtained 1085 longitudinal sampling events. We analyzed viral shedding events using entropy values to quantitatively assess whether they occur in a consistent, pulsed pattern in a given season.Results: We found that clear seasonal shedding patterns were common in bats. Eight out of seventeen species-level analyses presented clear seasonal patterns. Viral shedding pulses often coincide with bats' life cycles, especially in weaning and parturition seasons. Juvenile bats with waning maternal antibodies, pregnant bats undergoing immunity changes, and hibernation periods with decreased immune responses could be potential risk factors influencing seasonal shedding patterns.Conclusion: Based on our findings, we recommend future longitudinal studies on bat viruses that combine direct viral testing and serological testing, prioritize longitudinal research following young bats throughout their developmental stages, and broaden the geographical range of longitudinal studies on bat viruses based on current surveillance reports. Our review identified critical periods with heightened viral shedding for some viruses in bat species, which would help promote efforts to minimize spillovers and prevent outbreaks.",2025,,VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES,,,,WOS:001400938000001,10.1089/vbz.2024.0091,,#4062,Niu 2025,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper
Risk of Nipah Virus Seroprevalence in Healthcare Workers: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis,"Riccò, M; Cascio, A; Costantino, C; Corrado, S; Zanella, I; Giuri, PG; Esposito, S","Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic pathogen with the potential to cause human outbreaks with a high case fatality ratio. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, available evidence on NiV infections occurring in healthcare workers (HCWs) was collected and critically appraised. According to the PRISMA statement, four medical databases (PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Scopus) and the preprint repository medRixv were inquired through a specifically designed searching strategy. A total of 2593 entries were identified; of them, 16 studies were included in qualitative and quantitative analysis detailing the outcome of NiV infection on HCWs and estimates of seroprevalence among healthcare professions. All studies reported data from Asian countries: Malaysia, Singapore, Bangladesh, India (States of Kerala and Bengal), and Philippines. Seroprevalence was estimated from seven studies in 0.00% (95%CI 0.00 to 0.10) for IgM-class antibodies and 0.08% (95%CI 0.00 to 0.72) for IgG class-antibodies, but four of the sampled studies did not report any seropositive cases. A case fatality ratio of 73.52% (95%CI 34.01 to 99.74) was calculated from 10 studies. In conclusion, the present study shows that NiV may result in a possible occupational infection among HCWs involved in managing incident cases. As most NiV outbreaks occur in limited resources settings, it is reasonable that even basic preventive measures (i.e., mandatory use of PPE and appropriate isolation of incident cases with physical distancing) may be quite effective in avoiding the occurrence of new infections among HCWs.",2025,,VIRUSES-BASEL,17,1,,WOS:001404513500001,10.3390/v17010081,,#4066,Riccò 2025,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper

Recent incidences in Southeast Asian countries highlight the urgent need for effective risk evaluation and mitigation strategies.JustificationStudying NiV in Southeast Asia is crucial due to the geographic and epidemiological significance that makes this region predominantly susceptible to the virus.ObjectivesThis study aims to identify the risk factors of NiV, evaluate current mitigation strategies, and suggest improvements against this virus.MethodsThis review incorporates articles from the PubMed database related to available NiV treatments, vaccines, mitigation strategies, transmission data, and mortality to comprise an extensive analysis of pertinent information.FindingsNiV warrants international attention, due to the high mortality rate and the rising number of human-to-human transmission vectors. NiV is difficult to diagnose early on in the infection due to its generic symptoms, and the two strains of NiV (B and M), pose significant challenges to healthcare institutions. Vaccines, such as the VSV-stored, virus-like particle-based, and mRNA-based NiV show promising results in both animal and human studies. Synthetic medicines, like Ribavirin, and favipiravir showed promising results in NiV-infected patients. Therapeutic infectious particles increased survival from 10% to roughly 70%-80% in animals. Phytochemicals, like serpentine and neoandrographolide are alternatives to NiV-G ligands. Griffithsin, an algae derivative has also shown efficacy in treating NiV infections. Artificial intelligence determines the NiV infection with an accuracy of 88.3%.ConclusionsThe strategies to control NiV must be one of a One Health approach, incorporating environmental and social factors. Extensive research on vaccines that showed promising results in animals needs to be tested for humans on a large scale. The major mitigation strategy available is the public awareness during the outbreak about NiV transmission vectors, quarantine protocol, and food hygiene.",2024,,HEALTH SCIENCE REPORTS,7,12,,WOS:001369948300001,10.1002/hsr2.70239,,#4069,Rahman 2024,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper
Pandemic-Proofing: Intercepting Zoonotic Spillover Events,"Bhatia, B; Sonar, S; Khan, S; Bhattacharya, J","Zoonotic spillover events pose a significant and growing threat to global health. By focusing on preventing these cross-species transmissions, we can significantly mitigate pandemic risks. This review aims to analyze the mechanisms of zoonotic spillover events, identify key risk factors, and propose evidence-based prevention strategies to reduce future pandemic threats. Through a comprehensive literature review and analysis of major databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus from 1960-2024, we examined documented spillover events, their outcomes, and intervention strategies. This article emphasizes that targeting the root cause-the spillover event itself-is key to averting future pandemics. By analyzing historical and contemporary outbreaks, we extract crucial insights into the dynamics of zoonotic transmission. Factors underlying these events include increased human-animal contact due to habitat encroachment, agricultural intensification, and wildlife trade. Climate change, global travel, and inadequate healthcare infrastructure exacerbate risks. The diversity of potential viral reservoirs and rapid viral evolution present major challenges for prediction and prevention. Solutions include enhancing surveillance of wildlife populations, improving biosecurity measures, investing in diagnostic capabilities, and promoting sustainable wildlife management. A ""One Health"" approach integrating human, animal, and environmental health is crucial. Predictive modelling, international cooperation, and public education are key strategies. Developing pre-exposure prophylactics and post-exposure treatments is essential for mitigating outbreaks. While obstacles remain, advances in genomics and ecological modelling offer hope.

An emerging zoonotic disease to be concerned about - a review of the nipah virus,"Paliwal, S; Shinu, S; Saha, R","The Nipah Virus (NiV) was discovered in 1999 in the Sungai Nipah region of Malaysia. It is one of many emerging bat-borne zoonotic viruses that threaten global health security. The Pteropus fruit bats are identified as the natural reservoirs for the virus. NiV belongs to the family of Paramyxoviridae and is mostly present in locations surrounded by water, vegetation, and controlled or protected religious areas. To date, cases of NiV have been identified in Southeast Asian regions, with the highest number of cases in Bangladesh, totalling 305, with a fatality rate of 65%. The highest mortality has been observed in the Indian region, at 73%. NiV is an emerging zoonotic disease that needs to be focused on. The median incubation period is 9.5 days and the clinical features primarily lead to either progressive encephalitis or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.The diagnosis is conducted in Bio-safety level 3 or level 4 labs through Polymerase chain reaction. Human nasal swabs, throat swabs, urine, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are collected for diagnostic purposes. At present, there is no approved treatment or vaccine for the prevention of the disease. However, research on a vaccine against NiV is being investigated, and a subunit vaccine with NiV-G protein is found to produce potential efficacy. An outbreak in Kerala, a state in India, led to the implementation of an action plan involving lead agencies to combat the sudden surge of the virus. In the current scenario, appropriate preventive strategies are more effective in controlling the virus. However, emphasis should be placed on affordable and efficient diagnostic methods, treatment options, and vaccines to better manage the virus, considering the highest fatality caused by the virus.",2024,,JOURNAL OF HEALTH POPULATION AND NUTRITION,43,1,,WOS:001345239900002,10.1186/s41043-024-00666-5,,#4078,Paliwal 2024,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper

Improving clinical care of patients in Nipah outbreaks: moving beyond ' compassionate use',"Hassan, MZ; Rojek, A; Olliaro, P; Horby, P","The 2024 Nipah outbreak in Kerala, India-its fifth in six years-and the recurring annual outbreaks in Bangladesh underscore the persistent threat posed by the Nipah virus (NiV) in the region. With a high mortality rate, human-tohuman transmission potential, and the widespread presence of Pteropus bats, the natural reservoir, NiV remains a significant epidemic threat. Despite being a WHO priority pathogen, there has been no systematic effort to improve patient care for NiVD, leading to consistently poor outcomes. Current care relies on supportive measures and the 'compassionate use' of unapproved drugs like ribavirin and remdesivir. Drugs used 'off-label' during outbreaks can become the 'standard of care' without robust evidence of their safety or efficacy, complicating the testing of new therapies and perpetuating uncertainty about their true effectiveness. To improve NiVD care, we propose four key strategies: 1) Enhance early case detection, 2) optimize supportive care to improve outcomes and create a standard for future trials, 3) adopt a syndromic approach centered on encephalitis, and 4) explore innovative trial designs tailored to low case numbers as an alternative to 'compassionate use'. By integrating these strategies, healthcare systems in NiV-endemic regions will be better equipped to manage both current and future outbreaks.",2025,,LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH - SOUTHEAST ASIA,33,,,WOS:001411105100001,10.1016/j.lansea.2024.100527,,#4094,Hassan 2025,Exclusion reason: Not peer-reviewed paper; Christian Morgenstern (2025-03-17 00:04:06)(Select): Viewpoint; ,""
"The Current Pathogenicity and Potential Risk Assessment of Nipah Virus as Potential Cause of ""Disease X"": A Narrative Review","Mehnaz, S; Anjum, R; Mithila, FR; Dewan, SMR; Islam, MR","Background and AimsThe World Health Organization (WHO) recognized the potential for a severe international epidemic and introduced the term ""Disease X"" to classify pathogens that not yet identified. The Nipah virus (NiV) is highly dangerous due to its zoonotic nature, high mortality rate, and ability to cause severe clinical symptoms in humans. In this review, we gather the latest information on the NiV and its potential to become a significant candidate for Disease X.MethodsWe performed a thorough review of articles published in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar using appropriate MeSH terms and keywords. Studies reported NiV infection were considered for this review.ResultsThe NiV exhibits different epidemiological patterns in different countries that calls for customized prevention and control strategies. Genetic analysis highlights NiV's ability to mutate that alters possible treatment options. Transmission typically involves bats as the primary reservoir, with humans becoming infected either through intermediate hosts or food. This shows NiV's complex nature, including its ability to reach the central nervous system through the olfactory nerve. Promising treatment options, such as monoclonal antibodies, antivirals, and ongoing vaccine research, provide hope. However, the virus's adaptability, human-to-human transmission, and the lack of specific antiviral therapy raise concerns about its potential to cause a global pandemic. The interconnection between animals, humans, and the environment stresses the need for a One Health approach to tackle emerging infectious disease by NiV.ConclusionGlobal collaboration, surveillance, and research investments are imperative for the preparation of future pandemics.

The clinical manifestation can vary from a silent infection to a life-threatening encephalitis. The World Health Organization (WHO) has documented 25 outbreaks in South Asia, resulting in 429 cases and 307 deaths to date. Currently, there are no approved treatments for the deadly Nipah virus infection, which is a serious threat to public health worldwide. Consequently, a review was conducted to examine the geographic distribution of the Nipah virus, mortality, transmission pathways, and available methods for diagnosis and treatment.Methods:PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar servers were used to conduct a systematic search in compliance with the PRISMA guidelines. The results were tabulated and analyzed.Results:A total of 12 studies (7 case series and 5 case reports) were included in the final analysis, and 92 cases were analyzed. The most frequent symptoms were fever (80%), myalgia (47%), headache (47%), shortness of breath/acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 44.1%), altered sensorium (44.1%), and vomiting (42.6%). The most commonly used diagnostic test was RT-PCR (45.5%). The most common route of transmission reported is direct human contact with the infected patients.

Emerging Nipah Virus With Pandemic Potential and High Mortality Rates: Is the Scientific Community Learning From Former Pandemics?,"Klingelhöfer, D; Braun, M; Naser, CA; Brüggmann, D; Groneberg, DA","As Nipah virus (NiV) infection is characterised by a possible pandemic risk, being currently limited to a small but deadly belt, the attention of other countries is essential. It has often been pointed out that NiV is an under-researched virus with a high-risk potential. This study aimed to show the global research history and status quo based on analyses of various chronological and geographical parameters, including socioeconomic characteristics and research funding. For this purpose, advanced analysis methods and visualisation techniques were applied, such as density equalisation mapping and cluster analysis. The correlation between the number of articles on NiV and the economic strength or intensity of financing per country is significant. However, the comparatively low scientific commitment of countries that are usually among the major players in global scientific publications and the declining scientific interest in NiV research combined with the prevailing knowledge gaps in NiV infectiology in conjunction with the risk of NiV spreading to other areas is extremely threatening. Research on previous viruses such as Corona and mpox shows an equally short-term interest, which has led to an insufficiently prepared situation in the run-up to outbreaks, making it hard to find quick and effective solutions. As often said, the NiV infection belt is small but deadly, but global travel and trade increase the risk of spreading.

Therapeutics for Nipah virus disease: a systematic review to support prioritisation of drug candidates for clinical trials.,Chan XHS; Haeusler IL; Choy BJK; Hassan MZ; Takata J; Hurst TP; Jones LM; Loganathan S; Harriss E; Dunning J; Tarning J; Carroll MW; Horby PW; Olliaro PL,"Nipah virus disease is a bat-borne zoonosis with person-to-person transmission, a case-fatality rate of 38-75%, and well recognised potential to cause a pandemic. The first reported outbreak of Nipah virus disease occurred in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998, which has since been followed by multiple outbreaks in Bangladesh and India. To date, no therapeutics or vaccines have been approved to treat Nipah virus disease, and only few such candidates are in development. In this Review, we aim to assess the safety and efficacy of the therapeutic options (monoclonal antibodies and small molecules) for Nipah virus disease and other henipaviral diseases to support prioritisation of drug candidates for further evaluation in clinical trials. At present, sufficient evidence exists to suggest trialling 1F5, m102.4, and remdesivir (alone or in combination) for prophylaxis and early treatment of Nipah virus disease. In addition to well designed clinical efficacy trials, in-vivo pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies are needed to optimise the selection and dosing of therapeutic candidates in animal challenge and natural human infection.",2024,Nov,Lancet Microbe,,,101002,,10.1016/j.lanmic.2024.101002,39549708,#4289,ChanXHS 2024,Exclusion reason: Reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review paper
Understanding and addressing the global impact: A systematic review and cross-sectional bibliometric analysis of Langya henipavirus and pre-existing severe henipaviruses.,Li JD; Liu YQ; He RQ; Huang ZG; Huang WY; Huang H; Liu ZH; Chen G,"In 2022, Langya henipavirus was identified in patients with fever in eastern China. This study provides an overview of the scientific landscape, highlights research focus areas, and outlines potential future investigations. The relevant scientific literature was systematically searched and reviewed via advanced bibliometric techniques. Over the past two decades, henipavirus research has increased at an annual rate of 8.82 %.

"Identifying weather patterns affecting household date palm sap consumption in Bangladesh, 2013-2016.",Jackson J; Shanta IS; McKee C; Luby SP; Haider N; Sharker Y; Plowright R; Hudson P; Gurley ES,"Nipah virus spillovers via consumption of date palm sap in Bangladesh vary substantially between years and have been associated with lower winter temperatures and precipitation. However, the mechanisms driving the interannual variation and the influence of weather remain unexplained. Here we investigated the hypothesis that weather patterns change human sap consumption and explain interannual variation in observed spillovers. We analyzed responses from a nationally representative survey conducted in Bangladesh in 2013-2016 on household date palm sap consumption and weather data for each division of Bangladesh, using logistic regression to examine whether sap consumption is associated with weather variability. We found significant associations of lower minimum temperatures and precipitation with increased household sap consumption during the sap harvesting season. This relationship was largely similar within all months and divisions, and strong associations of temperature (χ2 (1, n = 5,027) = 7.74, p < 0.01) and, independently, precipitation (χ2 = 8.00, p < 0.01) remained strong after accounting for month, location, and annual sap season. Interannual variation in date palm sap consumption in Bangladesh is likely best explained by temperature and precipitation patterns, where colder, drier winter days pose a higher risk for Nipah virus spillover. The knowledge gained in this study may be valuable for targeting timing of future behavioral interventions against consumption of date palm sap in Bangladesh.",2024,,PLoS One,19,11,e0313904,,10.1371/journal.pone.0313904,39565803,#4311,Jackson 2024,Exclusion reason: No report of parameters (including seroprevalance and other measures of interest) or transmission or historical outbreaks; ,""
"Nipah virus survey in Pteropus medius of eastern and northeastern region of India, 2022-2023.",Mohandas S; Patil D; Mathapati B; Rai V; Shete A; Belani S; Kumar A; Sahay R; Yadav PD,"INTRODUCTION: India has experienced seven outbreaks of the Nipah virus (NiV) since 2001, primarily occurring in the southern and eastern regions of the country. The southern region has been the main site for these outbreaks. In contrast, the eastern region, which borders Bangladesh, has not reported any outbreaks since 2007. However, Bangladesh continues to experience nearly annual outbreaks, indicating a significant lack of surveillance in that area. To improve the country's preparedness and to gather support for enhancing public health surveillance in eastern and northeastern states near the area affected by the NiV, a cross-sectional survey was conducted to determine the prevalence of NiV in the bat species Pteropus medius in Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, and Meghalaya states in India, which are adjacent to Bangladesh. METHODS: Throat and rectal swabs, blood samples, and organ samples were collected. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was utilized for the detection of Nipah viral RNA, and sequencing was conducted for further confirmation. Bat IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed for antibody detection. RESULTS: Throat and rectal swab samples of 212 P. medius tested for NiV using qRT- PCR were found negative, whereas organ samples of two (one each from West Bengal and Bihar) out of the 10 bats collected tested positive. The retrieved NiV genome (~91%) showed close homology to the NiV-Bangladesh genotype indicating the circulation of two geographically distinct NiV strains in India. The seroprevalence estimated by ELISA ranged from 23 to 65% in the studied states. DISCUSSION: The serological and virological evidence obtained from the study indicates that a broader geographical area is under threat of spillover in India. It's crucial to implement a One Health approach connecting bat surveillance studies with human surveillance and risk factor studies in the region.",2024,,Front Microbiol,15,,1493428,,10.3389/fmicb.2024.1493428,39777153,#4317,Mohandas 2024,Exclusion reason: No report of parameters (including seroprevalance and other measures of interest) or transmission or historical outbreaks; Tristan Naidoo (2025-03-16 21:58:13)(Select): Reports evolutionary rate from another paper; ,Seroprevalence in animals

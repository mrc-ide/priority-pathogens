For assumptions, the model assumes a constant reporting rate (rho) across different regions and over time. It also primarily uses a fixed generation time of one week.They also used the GLEAM model but this is not the first time it was reported. GLEAM is a global, stochastic, metapopulation model (GLEAM) using an SEIR framework. It was parameterized with the time- and space-varying transmission rates from Model 1 and fitted to the observed number of MERS-CoV cases imported into countries outside the Middle East to estimate the overall reporting rate. This is a weird hybrid of a statistical and mechanistic model, but it does model transmission. 'incidence was modelled as the superposition of sporadic cases at a region-specific time-varying weekly rate pr sp(t) and of cases caused by human-to-human transmission with region-specific time-varying reproduction ratio Rr(t).'",173_001,MERS-CoV,1,0

The results were compared to real-world data, and SSM3 was found to provide the best fit. The model also explored the impact of random and targeted isolation interventions. ",137_001,MERS-CoV,1,0
